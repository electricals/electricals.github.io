<p>While the origins of a residential, commercial and industrial electrician may be the same or similar, the professions are vastly different. Again, the ground wire always gets connected to the green screw, no matter the wiring scenario. In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle. For switches, you will need to first remove the switch and then touch the tester to the sides of all wires to ensure that none are live.</p>
<p>Use only outdoor lights, fixtures and extension cords. At Ryan Electrical Services, our electricians can troubleshoot your home generator in order to ensure that it is operating effectively and efficiently. If possible, a drawing of the area and the objects for lighting should be sent to the technicians in advance for proper recommendations on installation. We did this by optimizing it for lighting applications, which rarely use a grounding prong and are the most common devices that are turned on and off with wall switches.</p>
<p>The popularity of outdoor living has brought a new focus to outdoor lighting. From landscape lighting to area lights and architectural sign lighting. Avoid overloading extension cords, power strips, or outlets. Most breaker boxes are 100, 150 or 200 amps.

<p>Heavy-duty extension cord ‚Äî Often the tools or equipment necessary for larger projects are powered by extension cords that are inadequate for the heavier electrical load. Ambient light is often found in the form of recessed lighting or other types of ceiling lights. A light switch is inexpensive and has small parts entirely contained inside a plastic casing, so if the switch is bad the best option is to replace it. But before you replace it you need to determine whether it is the light switch that is faulty or if the wiring is the problem.</p>
