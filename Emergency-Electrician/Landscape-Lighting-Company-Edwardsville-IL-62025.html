Again, the ground wire always gets connected to the green screw, no matter the wiring scenario. In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle.

<p>Use only outdoor lights, fixtures and extension cords. At Ryan Electrical Services, our electricians can troubleshoot your home generator in order to ensure that it is operating effectively and efficiently.

<p>Heavy-duty extension cord — Often the tools or equipment necessary for larger projects are powered by extension cords that are inadequate for the heavier electrical load. Ambient light is often found in the form of recessed lighting or other types of ceiling lights. A light switch is inexpensive and has small parts entirely contained inside a plastic casing, so if the switch is bad the best option is to replace it. But before you replace it you need to determine whether it is the light switch that is faulty or if the wiring is the problem.</p>
