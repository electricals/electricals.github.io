Today, almost all electronic devices have components placed on printed circuit boards. It is strongly recommended that you connect all cables and power cords to the unit for providing full maximum protection.</p>
<p>Concern for safety - Electricians work in dangerous environments which place them at risk of shocks and burns, so it's important to be cautious.

Electricians install, maintain, and repair electrical power, communications, lighting, and control systems in homes, businesses, and factories.
