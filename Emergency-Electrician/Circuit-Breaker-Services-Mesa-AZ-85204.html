Home standby generators are an attractive option for homeowners looking for the security of reliable power no matter what.</p>
<p>We created this electrical safety checklist for your safety and peace of mind, but it's no substitute for an annual electrical inspection by an electrician. For example, in New Jersey, contractor licenses are issued to firms or individuals who can show proof of at least five years of practical experience in electrical construction and installation and pass a written examination. Emergencies can happen at any time of the day, and when you need an urgent repair for your egress lighting, your safety and your occupants' safety shouldn't be left on hold.</p>

This may lead to many, if not all, of the electrical circuits in an older home to be easily and quickly overloaded.

<p>Repairs should never be made on live electrical circuits. The transfer switch also comes with a NEMA 3R enclosure that is suited for both indoor and outdoor installation. Though they work in different ways, they all protect the user against accidental electric shock and electrocution by acting immediately to shut off power to the appliance upon the detection of a leak” of electric current as may happen when a hair dryer falls into a sink full of water.
