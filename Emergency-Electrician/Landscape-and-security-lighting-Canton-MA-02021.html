<p>Surge protectors are often the last thing most people buy when setting up a new computer system. Above we see both older fabric-covered electrical conductors and newer plastic-insulated wires in an electrical panel. Rather than attending school to gain a degree, electricians get their education on-the-job. The main electrical panel is the heart of your home's electrical system, and your distribution point for all the electric circuits in your home. Using a single outlet protector will dampen the surge and protect electronic parts on the appliance. These black wires go on to the bronze side, and if you notice on the other side, you have white wires.</p>
