<p>You will benefit from using residential wiring diagrams if you plan on completing electrical wiring projects in your home. Unlike surge protectors, SurgeGuard from BGE HOME is designed to protect your whole home. Maintain safe distances from electric lines at all times.

Typically when I see a switch wired from a receptacle box the switch is being used to make one of the receptacles switchable while leaving the others always -on.</p>
