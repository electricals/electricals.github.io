Landscape lights have a moody beauty all their own, so it's natural to want to light up the night. To replace old outlets, you'll need to make sure it is grounded. If the outlet is already switched, but the tab is not broken, it means that both halves are switched.

The system will automatically shed” electrical items that are less important, then put them back online when more power is available. Regarding the voltage difference, when I mentioned I checked the voltage in an outlet, note that it wasn't the switched outlet but another outlet in same room.
