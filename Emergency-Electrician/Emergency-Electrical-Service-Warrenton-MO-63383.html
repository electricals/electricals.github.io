<p>Upgrading your main service panel is the best way to guarantee that your system won't leave you in the dark when you need it most. In many homes, if a room does not have an overhead light, most builders will install a switch that controls half of the outlets in the room. The majority of these electrical appliances require a 240V circuit. Use a circuit tester on the black and white wires to make sure there is no current.
