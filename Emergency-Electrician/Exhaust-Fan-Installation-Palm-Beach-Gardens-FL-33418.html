<p>Generators are becoming more and more popular these days. Natural Gas and Propane generators can be sensitive to both fuel pressure and volume, so high-quality connections are important. Sterlite Power (as a division of STL) was awarded India's first Independent Power Transmission Project under Tariff Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) regime.
