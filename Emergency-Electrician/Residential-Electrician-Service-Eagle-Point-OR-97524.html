<p>Electricity, it's availability and accessibility in our homes and businesses, is an afterthought for most of us. As electrical contractors, you allow us to use electricity without thinking about it. Even though we don't send you a thought of thanks each time we flip a switch (and maybe we should), your prior planning and expertise in a construction project are integral to our daily activities. If the light bulb is not going out, it could be caused by faulty wiring or an issue with the amount of power that the main panel is attempting to supply.</p>
<p>For instance, pairing copper wire with aluminum wire can cause corrosion problems which cause the connection to become unstable. The simplest and most common light switch is actually referred to by hardware dealers and electricians as a single-pole light switch.” With a single-pole light switch, flipping the lever up completes the circuit, turning lights or appliances on, and flipping it down breaks the circuit, turning lights or receptacles off.

More specifically, when electrical systems are damaged in a natural or man-made disaster, electricians need to make critical decisions about whether the electrical equipment that was damaged can be salvaged or not. Otherwise, frequent wiring issues, burnt bulbs, and other electrical problems that arise from faulty installations may burn a hole in your pocket.</p>
