<p>With the late nineteenth century seeing developments in using electricity for residential and industrial use, along with this came the electrician for installation and maintenance. If power stoppages continue or if a frayed or broken wire is found, contact an electrician. If the light still flickers or doesn't come on when you bypass the switch, the problem could be a loose connection somewhere else in the circuit and you'll either have to do further investigating or call an expert to diagnose the issue. 8 Training and licensing of electricians is regulated by each province, however professional licenses are valid throughout Canada under Agreement on Internal Trade An endorsement under the Red Seal Program provides additional competency assurance to industry standards.</p>
