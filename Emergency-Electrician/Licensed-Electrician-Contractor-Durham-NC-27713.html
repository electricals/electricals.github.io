<p>If your home does not have landscape lighting, there are two very good reasons why you should consider installing some. This poses danger to your bathroom electrical wiring, so it is best to install an exhaust fan so that air can circulate inside the bathroom space and no steam or moisture will build up inside. 2.

Motion activated lights adds security to your home, lighting up your home and warding off those that choose move in the dark.</p>

It is recommended that you turn off your home's main circuit breaker until you determine the source of the smoke while you wait on an electrician to arrive.
