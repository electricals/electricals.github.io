In areas with low natural gas pressure, the Guardian Series 22 kW generator can operate on natural gas pressures of only 3.5” of water column. Many low-voltage wiring installation manuals include a table of allowed wattages as a function of wiring distances and wire gauge. Applications for examination must be approved by the State Electrical Board. Here are a few tips concerning the potential hazards associated with your switches and outlets. Electricians are skilled at reading blueprints and technical diagrams, figuring out the best methods for installing new wiring, replacing old systems, identifying problems through the use of the proper devices, and following all state and local building and safety codes.</p>

Narrow beamed lighting that highlights sharp features and wide angled flood lighting to pick up flat surfaces are preferred.</p>
