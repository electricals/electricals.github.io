MM Electric provides generator repair, installation and maintenance services. And never run an extension cord through water or under flammable materials such as rugs. From the dramatic flare of our outdoor spotlights to the understated elegance of our path lights and well lights, Trex Landscape Lighting gives you perfectly custom illumination for your entire outdoor space.</p>
<p>If they are hot with the top wired, but not the bottom, then you can probably wire the outlet as a half hot.
