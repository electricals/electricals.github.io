<p>Breaker panels and fuse box panels are complex and delicate, and it's never a good idea to try and DIY your breaker panel upgrade or replacement. Nowadays people are turning to energy efficient lighting technologies to accomplish this by using lower voltage landscape lighting.

<p>You should contact an expert immediately if you have an obsolete electrical panel (for example, older Zinsco electrical panels ) or your panel no longer works effectively. All electricians, both residential and industrial, must be licensed by the state in which they work; some states refer to this as certification.
