The service panel is the point that connects your electrical system to the wiring that comes from outside the property. A surge protects the appliances from the TV to the small lines such as that of telephones. Because LV lighting is LV, it is very susceptible to voltage drop problems. This may well be already done in the box, though; otherwise you would have had TWO blacks and TWO reds to each outlet so that there was a black and red, both still hot, to supply the next outlet in line.</p>
