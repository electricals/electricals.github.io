In either case, having the wrong electrical panel for your residential or commercial property can cause electrical malfunctions or it may prevent your system from working at all.

<p>So, if you have a 3-ton (36,000BTU) air conditioner, for example, it will require a standby generator that is 11kW or larger. Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device. Portable generators usually offer between 2 and 8 kilowatts; 4 to 6 kW is usually enough to power a home's essential appliances, like lights and a portable heater, says Yago. Check with your salesperson when buying the transformer if it will do the job for the number of lights you plan to use.</p>
