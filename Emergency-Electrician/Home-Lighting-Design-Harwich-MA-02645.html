<p>Are you remodeling your home and need to install new lighting? The tasks involve troubleshooting for electrical faults, replacing faulty wires or other components such as light switches, electrical outlets and breaker boxes. Electrical Contractor License: This license is considered as equivalent to a master electrician license. Dim or flickering lights can be a sign of a serious electrical work issue, which is why you should call a professional as soon as possible.

Residential and commercial electricians typically charge between $50 and $100 per hour.</p>
