<p>There are only a few people who still perform electric installation, as it can be a dangerous task, especially if one is inexperienced. Some models come with a recoil starter, just like a lawn mower's starter, other come with an electric (battery) push-button starter, and other comes with an auto start switch, also called a transfer switch, that must be wired directly to your home's existing electrical system. It is possible that there will come a day when all of the lights are out because you failed to deal with the issue.</p>
<p>Others leave licensing requirements entirely to local governments. Many manufacturers integrate the PV cell to the light fixtures.

Make sure you review this article to see how all the connections should be made, including ground wires. Running a unit too close to its rated output reduces fuel efficiency and makes the engine run harder. When the automatic transfer switch senses that the generator is running and producing power it automatically disconnects the utility power line and reconnects to the generator power line, providing emergency power to your a home or building within seconds of a sudden power outage.</p>

The simplest and most common light switch is actually referred to by hardware dealers and electricians as a single-pole light switch.” With a single-pole light switch, flipping the lever up completes the circuit, turning lights or appliances on, and flipping it down breaks the circuit, turning lights or receptacles off.
