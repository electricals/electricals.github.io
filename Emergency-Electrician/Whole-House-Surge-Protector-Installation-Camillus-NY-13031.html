Size requirements - Size requirements refer to the need for a portable home backup generator or one that is stationary.</p>
<p>For instance, instead of 14 AWG ( American wire gauge ) copper wire, aluminium wiring would need to be 12 AWG on a typical 15 ampere lighting circuit, though local building codes vary. It's also worth considering the placement of light switches if family members are getting older or have lost mobility and would have trouble reaching a switch while seated in a wheelchair.
