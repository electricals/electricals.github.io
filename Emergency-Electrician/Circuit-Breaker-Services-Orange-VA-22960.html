<p>Return of investment of these systems really depends on how much you spend a month on your power and depending on how much you paid for your solar power generator it can takes a couple of years to make your money back. Experts say that in addition to the generator itself, consumers should also buy a transfer switch, which connects the generator to the circuit box of your home, and fuel for the generator.

In addition to whole home generator installations, we also provide generator repairs for existing whole-house generators in homes throughout the area.</p>

The generator has an output capacity of 12,000 watts on liquid propane and 10,000 watts on natural gas.</p>
<p>How the generators work can be due to the natural gas, liquid petroleum gas and plain gasoline that fuel it. If you use the generator for a longer period of time or throughout the day, you will need to refuel your generator in order to use it again if it stops. Certain wiring situations (such as where cable passes through walls, under driveways, etc.—always consult National Electrical Code and local codes) may require power cable to be installed inside rigid or flexible protective piping or conduit.</p>
