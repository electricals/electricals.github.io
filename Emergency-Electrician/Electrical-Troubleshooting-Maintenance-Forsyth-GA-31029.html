<p>Homes today are in more need of whole house surge protection than before. Some of the changes to restrictions that were set out in the new Part P aspect of the building regulations were seen as being controversial as under the new regulations, the undertaking of any work other than simple changes such as changing a light switch became notifiable to the local building control authority; so work such as any work in a kitchen or bathroom or work in other areas that are being re-wired will require a professional body, i.e. a trained electrician, to carry them out.</p>

Inspect portable cord-and-plug connected equipment, extension cords, power bars, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before each use.</p>
