<p>Few people understand the importance of using a surge protector with electronic equipment. The ON Smart Solution 4-Outlet Surge Protector offers the flexibility to charge while protecting multiple devices. This article will walk you through how a basic electrical outlet works, and a few different types of outlets you may have in your home. New LED bulbs also contain micro circuit boards that are sensitive and can easily be compromised by an electrical surge. Point-of-use surge protection devices are located at or near the equipment and have fax, modem, telephone and cable capabilities.</p>

Advances in Electrical Safety Codes throughout the years. Newer outlets have a third opening where the third prong of a plug can go in. As with the light switch, there is a grounding terminal located on the end of the outlet which connects the third prong of the plug to the grounding circuit. NEC 411.2 provides the definition for low-voltage lighting systems and states that one or more power supply secondary low-voltage circuits are permissible but each circuit is limited to 25 amperes maximum with a maximum voltage of 30 volts, ac or dc.</p>
