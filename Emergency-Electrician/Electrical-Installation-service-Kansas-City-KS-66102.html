Inside your house, you have a complex web of electrical wires just like you do veins in your own body.</p>
<p>There is an increasing need for surge protectors because high-powered devices are more sensitive when it comes to voltage spikes. A qualified electrician must be called in to install a transfer switch to plug the generator to the home wiring system.

<p>But even small surges through your wiring can mean big consequences to your home's electronics. Our trained electricians carry out even the most complicated residential electrical services in a professional manner. With a transfer switch, our team of electrical contractors will connect your generator to the panel, which will automatically connect to all the electrical wiring in your home. That's only necessary if you did NOT separate the white wires.

<p>Brint Electric is dedicated to helping those customers in need by providing commercial and industrial emergency electrical service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If there is no neutral wire in the switch box, such as in the diagram at the top of this page, you likely cannot use a smart switch. It's recommended to replace it after a major electrical event (such as when lightning blows out the transformer down your street). The easiest way to determine which type of dimmer you will need is to find out how many switches control your light fixtures.</p>
