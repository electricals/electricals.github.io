In some states, electricians have a number of options for working as an electrical contractor.</p>
<p>Many protectors will connect to all three in pairs (line-neutral, line-ground and neutral-ground), because there are conditions, such as lightning, where both line and neutral have high voltage spikes that need to be shorted to ground. The inexpensive, portable generators are almost a no-brainer to have around for the occasional outage. Some states also have multiple levels of master electrician licensing.
