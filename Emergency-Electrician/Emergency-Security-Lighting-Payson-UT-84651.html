<p>It seems like just about everyone reaches a point in their life when they want to be a landlord. From this spot - often referred to as the service drop or service wire - your service panel directs electricity to different parts of the home. Typical applications include monitoring ground cables, or a.c. voltage network cabling, to detect the effects of remote lightning strikes or surges due to machinery or switchgear. Our 24 Hour electrical repair team will arrive properly equipped, tooled and with after hour access to our local parts warehouse to minimize any additional delays or down time.</p>
<p>Our electricians have been fully trained in identifying problems with circuit breakers and panels.

A portable generator can provide power to run some basic electrical appliances like lighting, furnaces, televisions, refrigerators and water well pumps.</p>
<p>You also need to make sure you get a generator that can power everything you need (if you think you'll be running central air-conditioning, which requires a lot of power, you'll likely need to get a standby generator in the 17,000- to 20,000-watt range, for example), says Hoch. Bi-fuel and dual fuel generators fit these criteria. Electrical outlets and lighting switches will always stay the same size - only the overall dimensions of your switchplates will change.</p>
