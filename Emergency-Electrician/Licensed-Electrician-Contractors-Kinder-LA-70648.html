You can expect the whole house generator to start working within five minutes of power outage. Unlike portable generators, permanent standby generators can spring into action very quickly. You might carefully remove and re-route the existing wire lower in the wall or you might buy all new electrical wire - depending on the age and condition of the existing materials. Over time, the connections between electrical wires and switches or outlets can loosen Check to make sure that all outlet covers and switch plates are in good condition and that the wires inside are secure.</p>
<p>Electricians install, maintain and repair electric power in rural, residential and commercial areas. Apprenticeship Electrician: Must be at least 18 years old and pass an exam. But if there is the slightest danger that wires will be nicked by someone driving a nail into a stud though which the wires are run be sure to use steel plates to protect the wire where it passes through the studs. Let a licensed electrician deal with electrical issues. However, you probably don't even notice that at this moment, many of your electronic devices are experiencing a voltage spike.</p>
<p>So, if you have a 3-ton (36,000BTU) air conditioner, for example, it will require a standby generator that is 11kW or larger. Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device. Portable generators usually offer between 2 and 8 kilowatts; 4 to 6 kW is usually enough to power a home's essential appliances, like lights and a portable heater, says Yago. Check with your salesperson when buying the transformer if it will do the job for the number of lights you plan to use.</p>

For outdoor lights, it is best to choose one that has low wattage to save energy and to avoid lights that are too bright that make your garden look garish and tacky. When you shop for surge protection, you are quickly going to notice that there are many out there to choose from. Keep all surge protectors away from moisture of any kind.</p>
<p>Arc-fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs), installed at the service panel, protect against such dangerous shorts and are now required in new bedroom circuits. How to Become One : Most electricians learn through an apprenticeship, but some start out by attending a technical school. It actually sounds like this is the problem; confusion over what color goes where in those wires from the switch.

House lighting is in fact one of the most desired landscape lighting offerings.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to install an AFCI receptacle at the first receptacle outlet of the existing circuit. Standby generators can run on natural gas or propane. A transient surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting current to reduce the voltage below a safe threshold.

A circuit breaker is always sized to the load that it serves and the wire size it is supposed to protect.</p>
<p>An electrical panel is a central point that connects the wires from outside to the wires inside your home. Having a surge protector can protect you. Never touch anything electrical with wet hands or while standing in water.
