You might carefully remove and re-route the existing wire lower in the wall or you might buy all new electrical wire - depending on the age and condition of the existing materials. Over time, the connections between electrical wires and switches or outlets can loosen Check to make sure that all outlet covers and switch plates are in good condition and that the wires inside are secure.</p>

<p>So, if you have a 3-ton (36,000BTU) air conditioner, for example, it will require a standby generator that is 11kW or larger. Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device. Portable generators usually offer between 2 and 8 kilowatts; 4 to 6 kW is usually enough to power a home's essential appliances, like lights and a portable heater, says Yago. Check with your salesperson when buying the transformer if it will do the job for the number of lights you plan to use.</p>

When you shop for surge protection, you are quickly going to notice that there are many out there to choose from. Keep all surge protectors away from moisture of any kind.</p>
