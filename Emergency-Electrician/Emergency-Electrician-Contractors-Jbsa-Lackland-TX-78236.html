<p>Although it is permitted to wire lights and receptacles on the same circuit I usually avoid doing that for the sake of the people living in the home.

Generally, the more joules the better, as this means the device can handle one large surge, or multiple smaller surges, before your gear is in danger. I installed some LED tape lighting around the door of a pantry and used bell wire I think it was labeled.</p>
<p>Check your transformer's manual to determine what kind of cables to use for your grid, and make sure they'll work with your lights.
