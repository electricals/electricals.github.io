Wall washing is a landscape lighting technique that refers to the general illumination of a wall or surface. It is a feature that calls out the visitor's attention, making them take notice of the high milestones reached for the company's projects, man hours and employees.

<p>In addition to increasing your safety and security, landscape lighting is designed specifically for your home to highlight the beautiful areas and increase the value of your home. Since 1927, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) has produced the Canadian Safety Standard for Electrical Installations, which is the basis for provincial electrical codes. The lighting can intimidate possible intruders to avoid trespassing on to your property. Licensed electricians are also the only individuals who can authoritatively inspect wiring and rectify faulty installations.</p>
