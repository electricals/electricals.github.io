From this spot - often referred to as the service drop or service wire - your service panel directs electricity to different parts of the home. Typical applications include monitoring ground cables, or a.c. voltage network cabling, to detect the effects of remote lightning strikes or surges due to machinery or switchgear. Our 24 Hour electrical repair team will arrive properly equipped, tooled and with after hour access to our local parts warehouse to minimize any additional delays or down time.</p>
<p>Be sure to check the UL rating of the fixtures you are interested in. While all of the landscape lights in this assortment are save to use outdoors, some are available as damp-rated (they are safe to be exposed to water occasionally) and others are wet-rated (they can be exposed to any amount of water without harm).

Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>
<p>Home centers carry a limited selection of portable generators (but usually no standby units). Stick with one voltage - 120 volts AC.
