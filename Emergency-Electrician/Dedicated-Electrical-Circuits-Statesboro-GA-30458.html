An associate degree in electrical technology is perhaps the most popular option for future electricians who choose to attend two-year programs.

When that "other" switch is used to turn lights off, it was "down" and is now switched "up".</p>
<p>Electricity is important to the workings of the home, but can be dangerous, especially to children. Transmission and Distribution Construction services (includes electrical design, development, maintenance and testing services)Transmission lines carry high voltage current from the substation, where the power is produced.

This course is designed to familiarize participants with basic concepts associated with what motor controllers do and how they do it. Typical steps for starting up, checking, and shutting down motors are also covered.
