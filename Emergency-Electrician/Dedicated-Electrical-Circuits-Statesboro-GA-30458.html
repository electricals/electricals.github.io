When that "other" switch is used to turn lights off, it was "down" and is now switched "up".</p>
<p>Electricity is important to the workings of the home, but can be dangerous, especially to children. Transmission and Distribution Construction services (includes electrical design, development, maintenance and testing services)Transmission lines carry high voltage current from the substation, where the power is produced.

Typical steps for starting up, checking, and shutting down motors are also covered.
