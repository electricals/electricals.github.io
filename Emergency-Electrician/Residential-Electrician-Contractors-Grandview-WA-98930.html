<p>A registered electrician should always do new appliances in bathrooms and any new installation of cabling. Outdoor solar lights are a little more expensive to purchase but they are much easier to install. Electrical outlets without any protective covering over the holes of the socket pose a significant risk, particularly to young children. Instead of snaking a long cable around to reach all of your lights, use a few shorter lines that each include just a few lights and less total distance.</p>
<p>Portable generators should never be run indoors as they can produce fumes that can cause serious health problems or death if used indoors.
