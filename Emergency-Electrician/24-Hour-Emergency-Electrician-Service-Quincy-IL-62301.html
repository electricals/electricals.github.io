This connects to the generator so you can plug in appliances without running (potentially risky) extension cords outdoors. The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it. If they did, then you could add up 200 amps of solar since you would be coming in ahead of the main breaker.</p>
