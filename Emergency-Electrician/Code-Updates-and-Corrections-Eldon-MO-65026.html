Use surge protectors, says Danny Lipford, an Alabama-based home improvement expert who dispenses advice on TV, radio and his site, Today's Homeowner These handy devices may look the same as power strips, but in addition to offering multiple outlets, he says, surge protectors divert those brief jumps in voltage to a ground line—before the harmful jolts can reach your stuff.</p>
