<p>In fact, many families choose to install generators for their homes Sometimes even a minor storm can knock power out. 120V or 240V devices and the wiring supplying them are normally protected from overcurrent at an electrical panel or sub-panel using 120V or two-pole 240V breakers matched to the circuit wire size, such as 15A for #14 copper wire circuits, 20A for #12 copper wire circuits. Natural gas is rarely interrupted in most places, but you'll also require a plumber to come out and make sure that your generator is hooked up safely to the line in addition to an electrician.</p>
