You should never run a portable gas unit indoors because of the carbon monoxide fumes. Always be on the lookout for faulty electrical objects in your home or business - electrical safety should be a top priority. Residential electricians wire houses under construction, and upgrade older houses. So, you need to have a certified, licensed electrician inspect your breaker box.</p>
<p>The AFCI receptacle will provide downstream protection for the majority of the existing circuit and the new extended wiring too.

<p>Walk through the house and make a list of everything you want to power during an outage. Both of these numbers must be calculated: running watts represent the power consumed by an electrical motor while running normally, and starting KVA is required because each time an electrical motor starts up, there's an extra electrical surge that the generator must be able to handle.
