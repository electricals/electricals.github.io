<p>Fire is one of the biggest dangers facing domestic properties. If you find that you have one particular circuit that seems to inexplicably shut off, even with no significant electrical load on it, then you may need to replace a faulty breaker. Always best to disconnect power, but issues of insulation failure, lack of proper grounding, lack of GFCI, out-of-code wiring, generator operating without transfer switch, and other problems pose a risk to anyone working on electric power. Licensed electrician requirements also dictate proper insurance coverage - including Worker's Compensation, liability, and property damage.</p>
<p>Upgrading your service panel can clearly help in so many ways, especially when it comes down your family and their safety. You can purchase low voltage landscape lighting kits from the home improvement store, and these kits will probably include the transformer necessary to match the fixtures.
