Moreover, sufficient egress lighting must be installed at exit accesses, exits, and exit discharges. So no matter what size covers you need to use - tall, deep, jumbo, narrow, short - your switches will always fit the openings and screw holes on your wall plates. It's for this reason, among others, that electrical maintenance is such an important part of commercial building operations.</p>
