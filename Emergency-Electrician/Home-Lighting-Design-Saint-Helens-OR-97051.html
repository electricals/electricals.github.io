After a major power outage, they sent their service team in a snowstorm to service the generator and ensure it would keep us going throughout the snowstorm. Handy electrical contractors are used to working on jobs of all sizes. By catching such problems early, electrical maintenance helps reduce unexpected power outages and protects equipment from damage.</p>
