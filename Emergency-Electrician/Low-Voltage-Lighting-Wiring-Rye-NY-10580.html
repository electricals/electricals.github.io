When purchasing cables to connect your outdoor landscape lighting to the transformer, you'll want to make sure you have enough wire to run the lighting to your power source. When you need us, we have a licensed residential electrician ready to assist you with any electrical installation, repair, inspection, or emergency project.</p>

The ground wire can be continuous, tying the two ground screws on the receptacles together and onwards to the circuit ground.

Upgrade wiring - Having up-to-date wiring is one of the best ways to protect your home or business from an electrical emergency. There is usually some device inside the surge protector that handles this process of switching over to the ground when the voltage is too high.</p>
<p>Article 411 allows low voltage lighting that is either an overall listed assembly or individual listed parts.
