<p>Upgrading your main service panel is the best way to guarantee that your system won't leave you in the dark when you need it most.

<p>How much outdoor lighting you opt for is contingent upon the size of your home and outdoor space, of course, but once you decide which outdoor areas you want to illuminate, think about what you want the lighting to accomplish.
