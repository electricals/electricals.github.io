<p>Electrical installing work - to electricians. I want some lighting out there and I have a small low-voltage lighting project in mind, similar to what show in Figure 1 - though I did consider going for a Lampadaire exterieur , or outdoor lamp post first, after seeing them in people's gardens I'm fond of the low-level light the ones in Figure 1 show.
