If you have electronics plugged into power strips, make sure they have surge protection as well (not all power strips do!).

When you use a generator as an emergency power source in your home, you need to know the number of a reliable electrician if your unit stops working.</p>
<p>In many situations such as this, equipment damage could result if both contactors were closed at the same time.

While it might be tempting to scrimp on some supplies as a DIYer, electrical switches and outlets aren't one of them. Love the idea of outdoor lighting ; it is in the landscape plan.</p>
<p>Perhaps you've rearranged your furniture and realized that you need more lighting in a certain area of a room, or you may need more lights in a naturally dark space like a garage or basement.
