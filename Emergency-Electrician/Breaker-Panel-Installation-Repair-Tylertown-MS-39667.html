Surges can cause fried circuit boards on any of your home appliances, including washers, dryers, stoves, dishwashers, computers, smart devices, TVs, LED lightbulbs, and more.</p>
<p>It's that you should, make sure that your computers are safely off, before you attempt to do any electrical work to your home.
