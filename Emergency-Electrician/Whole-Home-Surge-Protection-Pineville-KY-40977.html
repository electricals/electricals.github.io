No other landscaping company in the Hollywood, Santa Monica, and Malibu area will offer you a 5-year warranty on a lighting installation. You should have the white from the panel and a jumper from the black to the panel connected to the outlet, on opposite sides. If you did not snip the tab on the second (or third or fourth) outlet, it will cause all outlets on the circuit to remain hot all the time. Residential electrical contractors perform upgrades to home offices and home theaters.</p>

Professional outdoor landscape lighting adds beauty, character and safety to your home - not to mention being the finish work of your landscaping.

But before you replace it you need to determine whether it is the light switch that is faulty or if the wiring is the problem.</p>
