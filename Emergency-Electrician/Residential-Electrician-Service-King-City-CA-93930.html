You'll find the most choices in white, ivory, and brown; somewhat fewer choices in black, gray, and light almond; and a more limited selection in clear, red, nickel and bronze.</p>
<p>That's when master electrician Allen Gallant, who has wired many This Old House TV projects, takes his customers on a job-site walk-through, showing where he plans to put switches, lights, and receptacles. It's basically going to cap the output at a certain wattage or voltage of electricity and return any unwanted electricity back into the home circuit loop. The number, color, and function of the wires at an outlet can be confusing if the original connections are lost track of. Whether the attachment method chosen is screws, push-in holes, or pigtailing with wire connectors, enough insulation must be stripped off the wire for good metal-to-metal contact, and wires should be tugged on to check tightness.</p>
