Having the neutral conductor in the switch box makes it handy to send power to other things such as receptacles as shown in the above diagram. The activities that happen in say, offices, restaurants, and hotels tend to be hard on electrical systems.</p>
<p>The type of fuel a particular unit uses, and how expensive it is or difficult to get in your area, should be considered when shopping for a whole house unit. Renovation projects often include installing automated environmental controls, relocating electrical receptacles, upgrading electrical panels, and installing new lighting. Practice extension cord safety. Maglio Electric technicians install multiple outlets per room to meet your electrical needs and free you from unsightly extension cords and power strips.</p>

<p>For example, devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners require large amounts of energy to switch motors and compressors on and off, creating surges in power that disrupt the steady flow of voltage. A good rule of thumb is to treat all wires as if they're live, so first connect the ground wire, then neutral wire, then load, and lastly hot.
