In general, the best practice is placing all your power outlets as far away from water sources as possible. Replacing or repairing your AFCI breaker is important to prevent any potential accidents that might occur as a result of using electrical components that would otherwise cause a fire. I guess which side depends on which end of the outlet is up. The side with white wires is never switched; it is always the black wire that is switched.</p>
<p>Nearly all household wire is copper, though aluminum is occasionally used. A surge protector or surge suppressor is an appliance or device designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead).

Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>

To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
