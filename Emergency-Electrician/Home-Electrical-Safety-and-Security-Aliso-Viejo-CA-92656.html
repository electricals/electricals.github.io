You can expect the whole house generator to start working within five minutes of power outage. Unlike portable generators, permanent standby generators can spring into action very quickly. You might carefully remove and re-route the existing wire lower in the wall or you might buy all new electrical wire - depending on the age and condition of the existing materials. Over time, the connections between electrical wires and switches or outlets can loosen Check to make sure that all outlet covers and switch plates are in good condition and that the wires inside are secure.</p>

<p>So, if you have a 3-ton (36,000BTU) air conditioner, for example, it will require a standby generator that is 11kW or larger. Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device. Portable generators usually offer between 2 and 8 kilowatts; 4 to 6 kW is usually enough to power a home's essential appliances, like lights and a portable heater, says Yago.

Fitted to the Generac 7033 standby generator is a 200-amp NEMA 3 whole-house smart transfer switch that is rated for both in- and outdoor usage. The free end of one wire will connect to the green ground screw of the outlet, and the other free end is to be connected to the metal box with a green screw (expressly for that purpose) or other approved means (special clips, etc).</p>
