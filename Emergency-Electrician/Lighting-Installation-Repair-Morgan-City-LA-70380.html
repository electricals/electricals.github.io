The armature of the DC motor acts like an electromagnet when current flows through its coils Since the armature (rotor) is located within the magnetic field of the field poles (stator poles), these two fluxes will interact.</p>
<p>In fact, many families choose to install generators for their homes Sometimes even a minor storm can knock power out. 120V or 240V devices and the wiring supplying them are normally protected from overcurrent at an electrical panel or sub-panel using 120V or two-pole 240V breakers matched to the circuit wire size, such as 15A for #14 copper wire circuits, 20A for #12 copper wire circuits. Natural gas is rarely interrupted in most places, but you'll also require a plumber to come out and make sure that your generator is hooked up safely to the line in addition to an electrician.</p>

Surge protectors get their power from standard household or industrial electrical sources and contain circuitry that prevents damaging or disruptive spikes or surges in the source voltage from reaching the devices plugged into them.</p>
<p>Walk through the house and make a list of everything you want to power during an outage. Both of these numbers must be calculated: running watts represent the power consumed by an electrical motor while running normally, and starting KVA is required because each time an electrical motor starts up, there's an extra electrical surge that the generator must be able to handle.
