Coho Lighting offers group relamping services as an effective way to maintain ideal light levels and decrease expenditures on lamp replacements.</p>
<p>Test each light fixture for its voltage level with a digital voltage meter (about $25 at Radio Shack). The black wires in the cables are used for connecting switches.
