Every Portland home needs to be outfitted with an entire home surge protector. If anything looks discolored, burned, or melted, turn off the power at your breaker box and call a qualified electrician immediately. While smart switches take a little more effort to install, they keep outlets available and can control more than one bulb.</p>
<p>Use only outdoor lights, fixtures and extension cords. At Ryan Electrical Services, our electricians can troubleshoot your home generator in order to ensure that it is operating effectively and efficiently. If possible, a drawing of the area and the objects for lighting should be sent to the technicians in advance for proper recommendations on installation.

<p>Home appliances, personal computers, heating and air conditioning equipment, cable and telephones, which depend on electricity, are sensitive to these surges. Do not force a power cord plug into an outlet if it doesn't fit. Portable generators are smaller and cheaper because they are meant to be used for very temporary occasions. We'll also find out what levels of protection are available and see why you might not have all the protection you need, even if you do use a quality surge protector.</p>
<p>An electrical panel is a central point that connects the wires from outside to the wires inside your home. Having a surge protector can protect you. Never touch anything electrical with wet hands or while standing in water.
