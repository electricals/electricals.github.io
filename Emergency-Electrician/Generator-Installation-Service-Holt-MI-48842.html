<p>Use only outdoor lights, fixtures and extension cords. At Ryan Electrical Services, our electricians can troubleshoot your home generator in order to ensure that it is operating effectively and efficiently.

We'll also find out what levels of protection are available and see why you might not have all the protection you need, even if you do use a quality surge protector.</p>
