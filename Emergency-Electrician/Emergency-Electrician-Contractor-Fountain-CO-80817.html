Advances in Electrical Safety Codes throughout the years. Newer outlets have a third opening where the third prong of a plug can go in. As with the light switch, there is a grounding terminal located on the end of the outlet which connects the third prong of the plug to the grounding circuit. NEC 411.2 provides the definition for low-voltage lighting systems and states that one or more power supply secondary low-voltage circuits are permissible but each circuit is limited to 25 amperes maximum with a maximum voltage of 30 volts, ac or dc.</p>
<p>If the power comes to the light outlet first, and then goes to the switch, then this can be done fairly easily as long as the outlet is accessible, isn't too full of wires already because the unswitched power is available as well as the switched wire that is connected to the light.

To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON.
