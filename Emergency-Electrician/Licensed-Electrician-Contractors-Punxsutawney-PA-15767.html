<p>It seems like just about everyone reaches a point in their life when they want to be a landlord. From this spot - often referred to as the service drop or service wire - your service panel directs electricity to different parts of the home. Typical applications include monitoring ground cables, or a.c. voltage network cabling, to detect the effects of remote lightning strikes or surges due to machinery or switchgear.
