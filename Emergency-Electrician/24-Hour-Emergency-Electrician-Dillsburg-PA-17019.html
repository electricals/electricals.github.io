It is usually near the point where wires enter the house. Installing an electrical box indoors or outdoors costs the same, about $800 to $4,000, depending on the amperage.</p>
<p>Many new panels grant homeowners the ability to add additional circuits as needed. An electrical panel is the point at which power reaches a property from the utility provider. For a simple outlet installation, the area for the outlet will be cut away and the wires attached to the outlet, but in many cases, the electrician may need to add a new circuit, which takes a little more time. There are other accidents that are caused by electrical wiring like electrical shock.</p>

<p>Walk through the house and make a list of everything you want to power during an outage. Both of these numbers must be calculated: running watts represent the power consumed by an electrical motor while running normally, and starting KVA is required because each time an electrical motor starts up, there's an extra electrical surge that the generator must be able to handle.
