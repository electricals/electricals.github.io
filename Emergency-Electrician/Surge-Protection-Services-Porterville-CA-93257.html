Regardless of your home's size, style, age or location, PowerPro will provide you with the peace of mind of knowing you have the correct automatic standby generator, installed properly and at the most competitive price.</p>
<p>Portable generators should never be run indoors as they can produce fumes that can cause serious health problems or death if used indoors. The circuit will never open now even if you remove the plug from the wires. In the 1960s up to the mid-1970s, aluminum wiring became a fairly popular option as copper prices were very expensive.
