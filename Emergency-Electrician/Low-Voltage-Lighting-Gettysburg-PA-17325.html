Also, a master electrician license is required. Choosing a certified, insured and licensed electrician for your electrical work is essential to ensuring the successful resolution of your electrical issues, and the safety of your home or business.</p>

Lastly, use bollard lights in place of pathway lighting anywhere you need extra illumination for safety or direction.</p>
<p>In the absence of state licensing or certification requirements, local governments like counties or cities may adopt regulations or establish their own licensing procedure. Do not use electrical equipment in wet conditions or damp locations unless the equipment is connected to a GFCI.
