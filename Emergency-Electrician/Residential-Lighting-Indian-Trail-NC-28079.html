<p>Standby generators also run a weekly test to check that they will respond well to an outage. Most of the time, they occur insidiously, when faulty electrical wiring heats up and begins to smolder gradually. Step 1. You will have to start by installing an electrical sub-panel and a transfer switch next to the main electrical panel.
