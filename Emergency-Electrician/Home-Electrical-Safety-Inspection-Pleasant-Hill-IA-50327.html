With over a century of experience working on all aspects of heavy-duty gas turbine technology, Ansaldo Thomassen (ATH) continues to meet the demand for clean, efficient and reliable power in an environmentally responsible manner. When electrical work needs to be carried out within your home it is important that you hire a professional to do it as electrical work that is installed unprofessionally could end up being dangerous and you and your home could be what ends up suffering as a result of it. This is why you should use the help of an electrician to do any wiring or electrical work that needs to be carried out.</p>

Higher-end lighting products and designs can be found in the WAC Lighting and dweLED product lines where the needs may arise.</p>
