<p>Two or three wires will be attached to the switch: an incoming hot wire, which is black; a return wire, which carries the load to the fixture and may be black, red, or any other color except green; and sometimes a grounding wire , which is green or bare copper. It is recommended that you turn off your home's main circuit breaker until you determine the source of the smoke while you wait on an electrician to arrive.

<p>They also do not trip as circuit breakers do so when they become overloaded, they are more likely to cause a fire.

<p>Smoking outlets and tripping breakers aren't just casual things that occur in every household, it clearly means something is wrong with your service panel.

<p>Lighting Tip: You can run 12-gauge about 100 feet without voltage drop issues as long as the total wattage of the fixtures on the wire is 100 Watts or less. But when the power goes out and an electrical system fails because of a tripped breaker, faulty wire, or natural disaster, it seems as if everything stops. Because electricians must travel to different worksites, local or long distance commuting is often required. All power outlets should be earthed or grounded to prevent electric shocks.</p>
