<p>Whether you're a contractor or building manager, it is important to keep Class 2 compliance in mind when retrofitting or creating new construction with low voltage LED lights and systems.

All outdoor outlets should have waterproof covers.</p>
<p>By using a larger fuse we may stop the problem of the fuse blowing all the time but the wire is rated to carry only 15 amps. To install a timer simply remove the plug from the outlet, insert the timer into the outlet, then re-plug the transformer into the outlet on the side of the timer. Remove the old lighting fixture, and make a physical note on paper detailing what wire goes where.
