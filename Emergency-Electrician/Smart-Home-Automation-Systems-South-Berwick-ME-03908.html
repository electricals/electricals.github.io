Cords under rugs pose a tripping hazard and can overheat, while furniture can crush cord insulation and damage wires.

In your switch box you should have one or more grounding conductors spliced together with a wire connector or wire crimp.</p>

Severe weather is the single leading cause of power outages in the United States. In this case, you need to contact an electrician immediately, so they can either repair or upgrade it.
