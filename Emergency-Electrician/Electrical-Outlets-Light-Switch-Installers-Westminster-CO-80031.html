<p>For residential services greater than 200 amps, surge protection is available for purchase only‚Äù at a cost of $399.00 plus tax with installation included. It is possible, and you can turn the power off and pull the outlet out of the box to see what is there, but if there are no other wires but those terminated on the outlet you would have to run another wire from the switch to the outlet. Knowing how long the job will take, and how many people will work with the electrician is essential.</p>
<p>Once you're sure that power is shut off to the wire that will be fed into the old-work box, insert the old-work box into the drywall opening with the power wire running through the drywall opening and fed through the old-work box with at least six to seven inches of the wire exposed (you can use a wire stripper to strip the wire ).
