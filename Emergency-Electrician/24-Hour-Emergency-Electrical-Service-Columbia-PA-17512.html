Upgrading your electric panel ensures that all of your new appliances are supported and that your family and home are safe from any dangers that might occur from overloading your system. Flickering lights are a sign that a home is very old, and the panel was designed for about 60 amps of electricity. If you have loose electrical sockets or frayed wires protruding from the wall, you should have the issues fixed by a trained electrician.
