<p>Many people are growing more and more energy conscious and there are many reasons for this.

You should also be able to explain how each type of circuit breaker extinguishes an arc, and you should be able to describe basic procedures for racking out high-voltage circuit breakers and performing routine maintenance and testing on them.</p>
