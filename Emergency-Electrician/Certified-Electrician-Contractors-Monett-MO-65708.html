One of the deterrents to more market adoption, especially for standby generators, may be price: John Hoch, the president of Power Equipment Direct, which sells home generators, says that a home standby generator will cost between about $2,000 and $5,000 or more (depending on power and size), not including installation.</p>
<p>The fixtures will be 95% if not 100% led.
