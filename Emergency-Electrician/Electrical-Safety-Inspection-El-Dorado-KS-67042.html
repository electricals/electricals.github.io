Electrical and fire safety officials warn that one misconnected wire can be deadly. Generac standby systems run an average $1,900 for a 7kW unit. Master - If you have not completed an approved apprenticeship program, you must show proof of six years of full-time experience supervised by a licensed master electrician.</p>

Safety Warning: Do not attempt to work on your electrical wiring, switches, or outlets unless you are properly trained and equipped to do so. Electrical components in a building can easily cause an electrical shock, burn, or even death.
