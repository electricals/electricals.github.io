Let's dive into what low voltage lighting is, how it's different from line voltage lighting, and the pros and cons of using this kind of system in your space. Although an electrical contractor in either field needs to be licensed and knowledgeable, he or she will have somewhat different areas of specialization, as homes and businesses require different forms of maintenance.</p>
<p>To determine the watt-capacity of your transformer, add up the total wattage of all the lights you plan to install and multiply by 1.25. Upgrading the electrical panel should be your very last option. The Standard for Luminaires, UL 1598, covers safety requirements for luminaries, however, low-voltage lighting systems are covered by specific safety standards for the low-voltage aspects of these systems. With time, the connections between wires and switches or outlets tend to loosen up. Make sure all outlet covers and switch plates are in good condition, and ensure that the wires are securely inside.</p>
