Or it can happen if someone in a nearby factory switches on or off a huge appliance with a powerful electric motor inside it, which might cause a sudden surge or drop in power in the whole circuit in your home.</p>

Residential electricians install wiring and troubleshoot electrical problems in peoples' homes, which can be either single-family or multi-family dwellings.
