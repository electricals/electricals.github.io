Every Portland home needs to be outfitted with an entire home surge protector. If anything looks discolored, burned, or melted, turn off the power at your breaker box and call a qualified electrician immediately. While smart switches take a little more effort to install, they keep outlets available and can control more than one bulb.</p>
<p>And since they're low voltage (you can literally add wires and lights to the system while it's operating), they're safe to use and install. This system is made up of low-voltage switches that operate relays that actually turn line-voltage on or off to the switched device.

All electricians, both residential and industrial, must be licensed by the state in which they work; some states refer to this as certification.
