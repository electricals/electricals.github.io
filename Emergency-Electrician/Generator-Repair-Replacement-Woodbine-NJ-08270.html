Working in the trade as a unlicensed contractor could cause you a lot of grief and possible legal problems as well.</p>
<p>If your electrical panel is very old and not designed to handle the electrical usage that is currently taking place, you may be facing a serious fire hazard. Service personnel came out and laid out the bed for the generator and installed a platform around the generator bed.

When it comes to electronic devices everyone wants their investments to be protected. According to the NEC , GFCIs are required in bathrooms, kitchens, basements, and garages; and AFCIs are required in many parts of the home and sometimes the entire home, depending on the state you live in. Check with your electrician to see if your home's electrical system is up-to-code.</p>
