Residential low voltage outdoor landscape lighting, as shown in Figure 1, has grown by leaps and bounds over the last decade. The wires in the switch box are all that you have to work with.

Journeyman License: 4-year experience in such activities as installation and repair of electrical wiring, systems, and equipment is required.</p>
