Journeyman License: Most municipalities require licensing but requirements depend on your location.</p>
<p>For example, devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners require large amounts of energy to switch motors and compressors on and off, creating surges in power that disrupt the steady flow of voltage.

Yago recommends running your portable generator for about a half hour every few months. Electrical Contractors are not issued with a plastic licence card but are issued with a Certificate of Registration.</p>
