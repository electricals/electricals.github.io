Again, the ground wire always gets connected to the green screw, no matter the wiring scenario. In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle. For switches, you will need to first remove the switch and then touch the tester to the sides of all wires to ensure that none are live.</p>
<p>Once one of our electricians has finished job, they will issue you an electrical installation certificate to verify that the job meets Irish Standard cable criteria. The NEC is the National Electrical Code The NEC's mission is to provide practical safeguards from the hazards that arise from using electricity. Installed along walkways, steps, and driveways, or pointing up at trees, walls, and fences, the typical low-voltage lighting system requires just three components: a transformer, low-voltage electrical cable, and the fixtures.</p>
