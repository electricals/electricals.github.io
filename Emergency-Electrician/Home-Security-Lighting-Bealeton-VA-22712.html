Tip: Both NM and AC cable require special cutting tools that cut the sheathing but not the wires; bushings inserted in the ends to prevent the sharp edges of the metal from damaging the wires; and special electrical boxes and connectors.</p>
<p>All outlets and switches should be cool to the touch. A wire has come disconnected and is no longer getting power. Training: the ease of learning and use are common to all our products, but if necessary, we also provide the training of the electrical staff in any of our equipment, to ensure the necessary expertise on the best use and performance of our equipment when providing your electrical contractor services.

<p>If you notice that your lights frequently dim, especially when you use appliances like microwaves, hair dryers, and air conditioners, your electrical panel may need to be replaced. The hot and neutral wires run from your electrical panel to the device that needs power. It is now code required to also have a neutral conductor at the switch for the use of electronic devices such as smart switches to control the light. Portable generators, true to their name, are easily movable, can be taken from location to location (such as camping trips) and are easily stored in an outdoor shed or garage.</p>
<p>Lighting Tip: You can run 12-gauge about 100 feet without voltage drop issues as long as the total wattage of the fixtures on the wire is 100 Watts or less. But when the power goes out and an electrical system fails because of a tripped breaker, faulty wire, or natural disaster, it seems as if everything stops. Because electricians must travel to different worksites, local or long distance commuting is often required. All power outlets should be earthed or grounded to prevent electric shocks.</p>
