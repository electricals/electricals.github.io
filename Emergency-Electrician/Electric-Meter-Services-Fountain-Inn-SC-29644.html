<p>Whether you own the home in which you live or you are simply renting for the moment, it is important to have a safe understanding of how your electrical circuit wiring works.

<p>Take a look at how the outlet is wired up. You'll notice that there are two black wires connected to the outlet on one side and two white wires on the other side, as well as a bare copper wire connected to a green screw.
