<p>One of the most important steps in installing low voltage outdoor lighting is getting the installation of your landscape lighting transformer correct. The lights can be placed along the stone path to make it possible to see the stones while you're walking down it. It also has a color-changing feature as most led lights do. You can pick out the color that suits your path the best. Our team at Epic Electrical has extensive experience installing, replacing, and repairing indoor and outdoor lighting.

<p>So, if you have a 3-ton (36,000BTU) air conditioner, for example, it will require a standby generator that is 11kW or larger. Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device. Portable generators usually offer between 2 and 8 kilowatts; 4 to 6 kW is usually enough to power a home's essential appliances, like lights and a portable heater, says Yago.

Lenses and grates can be easily installed on these fixtures for many custom lighting applications.</p>
<p>Take a look at how the outlet is wired up.

<p>Portable generators should never be run indoors as they can produce fumes that can cause serious health problems or death if used indoors. The circuit will never open now even if you remove the plug from the wires. In the 1960s up to the mid-1970s, aluminum wiring became a fairly popular option as copper prices were very expensive.
