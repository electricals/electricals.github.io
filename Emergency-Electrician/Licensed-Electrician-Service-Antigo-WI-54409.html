<p>The application of LED's as landscape lighting fixtures was realized in the later half of the 20th century as more and more people focused in furthering lawn improvements and finding new ways to enhancing landscape designs with lights that would not pose much risk and at the same time would cut the operational cost over time. Except for farm wiring in some locations, a person or company acting as an electrical contractor in Michigan must be licensed by the State or in some cases the governmental jurisdiction in which the business is located or the person resides.</p>

If that power spikes all of a sudden it can damage your electronics. Prospective electrical contractors normally complete several years of apprenticeship training and acquire a license prior to starting a career.
