<p>This wiring as pre-existing or "old-work" electrical wiring, is still described in the U.S. National Electrical Code (2005) in Article 394. Many homes built before the 1960's are powered by electrical panels that are equipped with fuses. Fuse boxes are not as much of a concern as the fuses that you have to put in them.
