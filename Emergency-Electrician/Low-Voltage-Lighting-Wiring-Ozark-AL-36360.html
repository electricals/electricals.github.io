However, smaller portables such as 1000 watts units can be used for such things as microwaves, toasters and other electrical cooking devices. Most homes on the city grid often use natural gas to power space heating and other appliances, including backup generators. Also, these specialists are obliged to work under the supervision of a master or journeyman electrician. Whatever function you choose, one of the big advantages to using this kind of outdoor lighting is that you don't have to run cables or wiring of any kind.</p>
