<p>It's really hard to fork out the money to replace expensive electronic equipment that has been damaged beyond repair. This helps protect people from being shocked, and it prevents fires due to electrical faults. Bill Locklin the inventor of the original 12 volt garden lighting system in the mid 1950's knew better than anyone how potentially dangerous 12 volts can be and in some cases even more dangerous than 120 volt main power.

<p>Electricians work inside or outside buildings to ensure lights, industrial equipment, and appliances operate safely and reliably. Inspect the ends of each circuit breaker in the service panel, looking for one that has its switch leaning toward the off side rather than on. Some circuit breakers, instead, have a red button that can pop out if tripped.
