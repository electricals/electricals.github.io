<p>In order to know the gauge of the wire and the circuit information, you'll have to check the cable-sheath labeling.

<p>This course covers three-phase alternating current (AC) induction motors, which use magnetic induction to convert three-phase AC power into mechanical energy. In this configuration, all power for the circuit runs through the metal linkage within the receptacle itself. An installation of a home generator is recommended so that once the electrical supply is out, your generator will immediately respond by providing you with continuous electricity as if no power interruption happened.</p>
