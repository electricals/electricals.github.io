An electrician working on a commercial or industrial building must be able to correctly size loads.</p>
<p>Charging stations for electric vehicles can increase power consumption as much as 50 amps at 220 volts.

Lighting transformers come in a variety of sizes and you will need one big enough to handle the number and wattage of the light bulbs it will be powering.</p>
