<p>Neither the switch nor the light fixture is likely to have both available, although it is possible, depending on how the room was wired in the first place. For example, the power supply (transformer) unit may be marked with an input rating of 120 volts, 60 hertz, 3 amps with the output rated at 12 volts and 300 watts.
