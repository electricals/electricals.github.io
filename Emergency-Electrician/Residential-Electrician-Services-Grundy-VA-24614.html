You're in your business, and you're darn good at it. Unfortunately, that means that many (or most) electrical contractors all look the same. Generally, the more joules the better, as this means the device can handle one large surge, or multiple smaller surges, before your gear is in danger.

<p>We can say that it is a good device if it gives you more than the protection you need. Around 10 watts of power running through halogen bulbs gives you complete control over your deck lighting needs.
