<p>Surge protection products help guard against power surges and lightning that cause a major concern for many of our members. This covers common installations and issues with residential wiring, including lighting, major appliances, alarms, telephones, media and sound, wiring additions and working with out-of-date wiring and components. Contact us anytime, day or night, and we'll send out a licensed electrician who can diagnose and repair your system.

<p>You also need to make sure you get a generator that can power everything you need (if you think you'll be running central air-conditioning, which requires a lot of power, you'll likely need to get a standby generator in the 17,000- to 20,000-watt range, for example), says Hoch.

Determine where and how you are going to use your landscape lighting kit before determining how many lumens you need.</p>

Our experienced master electricians will evaluate your company's unique needs to determine the proper number, type, and placement of light fixtures and switches.
