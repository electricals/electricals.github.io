If you go a long period without needing your portable backup generator, you may spend a lot of money on gasoline you cannot use.</p>
<p>For safe wire connections, cut all the wires to leave at least 6 in. protruding past the face of the box. The first and most likely is that the contacts involved are not properly closing and are making a poor connection, which prevents them passing current to the coil as they should.

This kind of generators is portable ones and is advantageous when you will use it for a short period of time. However, don't leave gas in the portable generator for long periods. Buy a larger transformer than you'll initially need so you can add lights later as your landscape (and imagination) expands.
