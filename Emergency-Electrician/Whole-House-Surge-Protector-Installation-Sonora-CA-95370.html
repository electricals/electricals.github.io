To prevent an electrical fire, give us a call right away to schedule a breaker panel inspection.</p>

<p>It's really hard to fork out the money to replace expensive electronic equipment that has been damaged beyond repair. This helps protect people from being shocked, and it prevents fires due to electrical faults. Bill Locklin the inventor of the original 12 volt garden lighting system in the mid 1950's knew better than anyone how potentially dangerous 12 volts can be and in some cases even more dangerous than 120 volt main power. Since it's solar powered you don't have to rip apart your garden to install electrical wiring-just place the sturdy stakes into the ground and that's it.

Our GCFI outlets are designed with life saving features including the continuous assessment of electricity running through the residential circuit. Circuit breakers on the other hand, just need to be switched back in order to function again. The electric company, and not the electrician , must disconnect and reconnect the power line.</p>
<p>You can go all out and buy the best you can afford, but you'll save some money by buying a surge protector appropriate for the equipment you'll use it with. The best places where you can install low voltage lighting are on your porches, gardens, walkways and decks. I would highly recommend TLC and Shannon for their amazing customer service, professionalism and quality work. The cost is dependent on many factors: number of fixtures (in trees, path lights, spots, can lights, specialty lights, etc.), number of transformers, vegetation and maturity of plants, timing controls & automation, whether pruning is necessary, how many specialty fixtures are onsite, etc.</p>
