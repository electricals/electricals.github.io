<p>It's really hard to fork out the money to replace expensive electronic equipment that has been damaged beyond repair. This helps protect people from being shocked, and it prevents fires due to electrical faults.

Our GCFI outlets are designed with life saving features including the continuous assessment of electricity running through the residential circuit. Circuit breakers on the other hand, just need to be switched back in order to function again. The electric company, and not the electrician , must disconnect and reconnect the power line.</p>
<p>You can go all out and buy the best you can afford, but you'll save some money by buying a surge protector appropriate for the equipment you'll use it with. The best places where you can install low voltage lighting are on your porches, gardens, walkways and decks. I would highly recommend TLC and Shannon for their amazing customer service, professionalism and quality work. The cost is dependent on many factors: number of fixtures (in trees, path lights, spots, can lights, specialty lights, etc.), number of transformers, vegetation and maturity of plants, timing controls & automation, whether pruning is necessary, how many specialty fixtures are onsite, etc.</p>
