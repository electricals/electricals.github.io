<p>Electrical wire and cable is a high volume item in the wire and cable field. A: When contracting with the public and requesting permits, your business must be licensed as an electrical contractor.

Electrical and fire safety officials warn that one misconnected wire can be deadly. Generac standby systems run an average $1,900 for a 7kW unit.

If necessary, remove all the wires but one, check the outlet for power, and then use a different wire.</p>
