Cords under rugs pose a tripping hazard and can overheat, while furniture can crush cord insulation and damage wires. That's why a lot of employers recommend getting some basic electrical training before applying for the apprenticeships that they sponsor. In your switch box you should have one or more grounding conductors spliced together with a wire connector or wire crimp.</p>

<p>When considering an upgrade to your home's electrical wiring, you must take into account the age of your home and the age of the current wiring that is installed. Lights in your home do little good if you can't turn them on, and the power going through your home is useless if your outlets aren't ready and capable to handle appliances. Flickering fluorescent lights, broken light switches, and old wiring are no match for lighting repair professionals.
