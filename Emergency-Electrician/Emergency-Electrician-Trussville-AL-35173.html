<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in Trussville</h2>
<p>With a well designed landscape, homeowners want to spend as much time as possible outside. Well in a parallel circuit, each light has its own circuit (or its on hot and neutral wire) and the voltage across each of the components is the same; the current increases, but the voltage stays the same. If your outlets are warm, or extension cords get hot, they are probably overloaded. A new service panel can enhance safety and property value. As skilled tradesmen that perform highly specialized and potentially dangerous work, electricians are subject to strict licensing requirements that must be met to legally practice their craft.</p>
<p>First things first: A backup generator is an electrical system that allows homes to maintain power on some (or all) appliances during an outage. Always use a registered electrician to install new appliances. Shoes - Avoid damp or wet areas when using electrical power tools outdoors. Our licensed electricians have the experience and knowledge needed to install smoke detectors and make recommendations so that you and your family can feel protected from possible fire hazards.</p>
<p>So, if you have a 3-ton (36,000BTU) air conditioner, for example, it will require a standby generator that is 11kW or larger. Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device. Portable generators usually offer between 2 and 8 kilowatts; 4 to 6 kW is usually enough to power a home's essential appliances, like lights and a portable heater, says Yago. Check with your salesperson when buying the transformer if it will do the job for the number of lights you plan to use.</p>

We have been serving the Raleigh , Durham Apex , Cary , Chapel Hill , Morrisville , and Garner communities with emergency electrical service calls for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>Before you do any digging, call a professional locator service, and carefully look around your property for where sprinkler lines, water mains, cable TV and phone wires are buried. Use cords that are in good shape, with no fraying or exposed wiring. Believe it or not, not all electricians‚Äù know what they are doing.
