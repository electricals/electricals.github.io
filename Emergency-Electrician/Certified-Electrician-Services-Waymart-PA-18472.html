<p>There are many factors and considerations with residential wind generators which might make this energy solution the right option for you. Repairs could be minor and nominal in cost, such as the cleaning and tightening of connections or the addition of outlets, or more involved running into several thousand dollars, such as the addition of circuits and sub-panels, replacement of degraded wiring, or, particularly with older homes, a heavy-up” — that is, upgrading the electrical service from, for example, 60 amp or 100 amp service to the home to 200 amp service better able to handle today's electric demands.</p>

Wired remote control of lighting switches is also possible using, for example, X10 signaling over the power wires.

Outdoor lighting, including pathway lights, landscape spotlights, landscape flood lights, deck and step lights and bollards, can be both practically functional and can add to the overall aesthetic of your home.</p>

<p>If a breaker keeps tripping immediately after it's reset but the circuit's not overloaded, contact a licensed electrician immediately. If you purchase a transformer that doesn't have a photocell light sensor, you will probably be adjusting the on time about every 2 months, remember, I learned this through trial and error, it wasn't a big deal at first, but it seems to wear on me after a few years.
