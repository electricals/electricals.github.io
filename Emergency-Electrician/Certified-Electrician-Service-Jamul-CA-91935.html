If you go a long period without needing your portable backup generator, you may spend a lot of money on gasoline you cannot use.</p>

<p>After completing an apprenticeship program, electricians are considered to be journey workers and may perform duties on their own, subject to any local or state licensing requirements. If you do not need to move the generator around and are primarily using it as a backup source, you would probably want to stick with a standby generator.
