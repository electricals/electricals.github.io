<p>Home appliances, personal computers, heating and air conditioning equipment, cable and telephones, which depend on electricity, are sensitive to these surges. Do not force a power cord plug into an outlet if it doesn't fit. Portable generators are smaller and cheaper because they are meant to be used for very temporary occasions. We'll also find out what levels of protection are available and see why you might not have all the protection you need, even if you do use a quality surge protector.</p>
<p>As you can see, a lamp with a design voltage of 12 Volts will deliver 80% of its light output and its life will double by reducing the voltage to 11.5 Volts.

Backup power generators can provide you with peace of mind knowing the important outlets and appliances in your home will continue to work even in the worst weather.
