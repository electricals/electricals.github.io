You can probably tell by the construction of these electrical cables which one is the cheapest and most expensive but I will tell you anyways. Most lights are attached with quick connectors to ease installation. I'm afraid that unless there is another black wire that is hot all the time in the outlet box you're out of luck here.</p>
