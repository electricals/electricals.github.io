It's also worth considering the placement of light switches if family members are getting older or have lost mobility and would have trouble reaching a switch while seated in a wheelchair. A digital timer may be used for more complex lighting systems where multiple start times are required including start times on different days of the week.</p>
<p>Home centers carry a limited selection of portable generators (but usually no standby units). Stick with one voltage - 120 volts AC. Also, don't touch electrical equipment, including light switches and power cords, with wet or damp hands. This will be the biggest switch on the electrical panel, and will often be in the form of two switches fused together. For more than a century, Westinghouse has consistently provided innovative, reliable, high-quality products and customer service.</p>
