<p>Decks are more likely to be used at night than in the daytime. Since low voltage lighting gives lesser illumination, each lighting fixture should be 8 to 10 feet away from each other. Green or bare copper are ground wires. To sum up, whether you need light fixtures installed or replaced, or lighting problems fixed, such as a loose wire in the socket, a tripped breaker and a blown fuse, as well as have circuit path issues addressed, we've got you covered. Water conducts electricity, and you could get an electric shock.

Many homeowners are exploring the benefits and growing array of options available in low voltage lighting.
