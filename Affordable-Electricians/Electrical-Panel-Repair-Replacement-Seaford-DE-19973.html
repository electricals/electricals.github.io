<p>They may work independently or for an electrical contractor, which is a company that employs electricians. Don't use any circuits that look damaged and don't try to replace anything or flip breakers on your own. One should never forget to set the timer on the transformer so that the whole thing lights up just in time. The problem is when the power comes to the switch, and then from the switch to the light outlet (or lights), and only on a 2-wire cable. At R. D.

<p>Two or three wires will be attached to the switch: an incoming hot wire, which is black; a return wire, which carries the load to the fixture and may be black, red, or any other color except green; and sometimes a grounding wire , which is green or bare copper.
