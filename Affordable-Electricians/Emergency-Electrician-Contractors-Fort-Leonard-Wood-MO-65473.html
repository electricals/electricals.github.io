A heavy-up electrical panel upgrade improves the safety and reliability of your electrical system, adds value to your home or business and gives you peace of mind. When purchasing cables to connect your outdoor landscape lighting to the transformer, you'll want to make sure you have enough wire to run the lighting to your power source. When you need us, we have a licensed residential electrician ready to assist you with any electrical installation, repair, inspection, or emergency project.</p>

Upgrading your service panel can help reduce your homeowner's insurance bill since you reduced the overall risk of your home which conversely allows your to qualify for a discount on your annual bill. In some states, electricians have a number of options for working as an electrical contractor.</p>

Bare or exposed copper cables as well as green wires are basically utilized for grounding installations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, having the whole house covered against electricity surge doesn't mean you have one of such devices linked to each outlet in the house.
