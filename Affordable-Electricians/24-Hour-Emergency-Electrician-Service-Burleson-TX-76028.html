Most homes on the city grid often use natural gas to power space heating and other appliances, including backup generators. Also, these specialists are obliged to work under the supervision of a master or journeyman electrician.

<p>If a 14-2 cable is run from the panel to the outlet, then a 15 amp circuit breaker is the largest that can be used to protect that circuit. This kind of generators is portable ones and is advantageous when you will use it for a short period of time. However, don't leave gas in the portable generator for long periods. Buy a larger transformer than you'll initially need so you can add lights later as your landscape (and imagination) expands.
