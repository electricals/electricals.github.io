<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Contractor in Poughkeepsie</h2>
<p>With a well designed landscape, homeowners want to spend as much time as possible outside. Well in a parallel circuit, each light has its own circuit (or its on hot and neutral wire) and the voltage across each of the components is the same; the current increases, but the voltage stays the same.
