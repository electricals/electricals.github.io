Many homes built before the 1960's are powered by electrical panels that are equipped with fuses. Fuse boxes are not as much of a concern as the fuses that you have to put in them. Also, do not touch electrical appliances with wet hands. Spot lights can be angled and used with shrouds to direct the light exactly where desired.</p>
<p>The average homeowner should not attempt to install electrical outlets, particularly if you are making the switch to a 3-pronged outlet.
