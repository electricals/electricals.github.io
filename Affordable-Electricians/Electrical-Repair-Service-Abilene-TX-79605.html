<p>Fire is one of the biggest dangers facing domestic properties. If you find that you have one particular circuit that seems to inexplicably shut off, even with no significant electrical load on it, then you may need to replace a faulty breaker. Always best to disconnect power, but issues of insulation failure, lack of proper grounding, lack of GFCI, out-of-code wiring, generator operating without transfer switch, and other problems pose a risk to anyone working on electric power.
