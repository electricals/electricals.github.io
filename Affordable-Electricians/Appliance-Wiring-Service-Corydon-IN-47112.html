Improperly sized overload elements of any of the several types available could cause unnecessary tripping of the contactor and shutdown of the motor if the elements are undersized. Continued Power: With a standby generator, the failure of your power will cause your generator to automatically turn on, and it will automatically shut off when power returns. Those who have no training, need to have 5 years of working experience in planning, laying out, supervision or installation of electrical systems.</p>

Section 411.4 states that low-voltage lighting systems must not be concealed or the wiring must not extend through a building wall, unless using a wiring method specified in chapter 3. The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
