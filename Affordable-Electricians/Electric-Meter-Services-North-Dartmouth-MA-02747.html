<p>Decks are more likely to be used at night than in the daytime. Since low voltage lighting gives lesser illumination, each lighting fixture should be 8 to 10 feet away from each other. Green or bare copper are ground wires. To sum up, whether you need light fixtures installed or replaced, or lighting problems fixed, such as a loose wire in the socket, a tripped breaker and a blown fuse, as well as have circuit path issues addressed, we've got you covered. Water conducts electricity, and you could get an electric shock. Use extreme caution whenever you're working on the electrical system, and if you are not confident about doing the job safely, contact a qualified, licensed electrician.</p>

Occasional light installation issues happen every now and then in most households. They may also be caused by birds, animals and trees interfering with power lines, auto accidents involving utility poles, neighbors using major power equipment, faulty home wiring and many other factors.</p>
<p>Malfunctioning Electrical Panel: Remember that an electrical panel is the root of your home's electric system. Most landscape architects will include a lighting scheme with their design.
