<p>Being able to use your yard or garden after the sun goes down can help you get a lot more enjoyment out of it. If you are like most people, you probably work during the day. Hi, I am curious if while running garage electrical wiring, you can, or can not, run the wire from the electrical Outlet, DOWN the stud, across, then Back Up to the next Outlet.
