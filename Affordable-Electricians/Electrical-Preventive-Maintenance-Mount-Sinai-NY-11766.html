<p>The breakers work by interrupting the flow of electricity when they detect one of these two issues. These outlets do not have a grounding wire within the electrical system. In the past, fixtures were attached at different locations along the main wire path using clunky two- piece wire piercing connectors or the line was cut and specialty gel filled wire nuts were used to make the splice.

<p>Solar outdoor lights are probably the most popular type of outdoor lighting available on the market. If necessary, cut the sod around the light fixtures with the shovel.
