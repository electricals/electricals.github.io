<p>Electrical maintenance is among the most essential factor in the life of any home that makes up for overall functionality and indoor comfort. Once the backup generator senses the utility power is back on, your home is automatically transferred to the utility power. One of the best ways to safeguard your work, your refrigerated food and your comfort is with a home backup generator installed by Conductive Electrical Contracting. You should check your house for electrical safety at least once every ten years, or if you have recently moved into a new home. Standby generators use an automatic transfer switch (ATS) that connects your generator to your electrical system.</p>

Taking into account how pricey these units are, be sure to go for at least 5-year warranty for whole house generators. These old 3-wire low voltage switches have been discontinued.
