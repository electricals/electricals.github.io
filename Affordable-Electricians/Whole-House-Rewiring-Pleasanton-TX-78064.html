In fact all wiring should only be done by a certified professional electrician. Portable generators provide power in remote locations, such as construction sites, for short periods of time. If you have a home that's older than 30 years and all of the electrical is original to the house, this is an aspect of home maintenance that you should be aware of. Circuit breakers that are old might not have enough capacity to keep up with today's needs, or you might even have a fuse box, which is an outdated system.</p>
