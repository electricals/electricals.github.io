<p>You may wonder how you can tell which fuse or breaker governs a non-working light or outlet. If you are tired of those incessant blown out fuses, now is the opportunity of having a new electrical panel installation.

If you find a warm or hot outlet, shut the circuit off at the breaker box and call an electrician immediately.

Once you are settled in your home and spending some quiet time out on your back deck or patio take some time in the evening to imagine what your back yard or garden area would look night after nightfall if you had some strategically placed lighting incorporated into your landscape and other areas and do not forget to think about adding some additional or different deck lights and lighting surrounding the areas close to the house.</p>
