<p>PowerPro is the largest generator company on Long Island, offering more brands of standby generators than any other emergency power company. If you're planning a remodeling projects for your kitchen or bath, count on the electricians at Acosta to provide the electrical and lighting services you need. Most power surges originate inside your home or building and result from motorized or noisy” equipment. According to The Hartford , there are many common causes of electrical fires and signs to be aware of. Here are a few tips to keep your family safer.
