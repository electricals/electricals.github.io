<p>Improper Installation - If your home's breaker panel wasn't installed correctly the first time around, you may be experiencing frequent issues with it. Some surge protectors allow you time enough to shut down your computer without losing data or causing damage. Flickering lights, odd sounds from a fuse box, tripping breakers, and even smoke coming from outlets or outlets with burning smells are all warning signs of an outdated panel.

TIP: Many light switches can also be used to power new electrical outlets.</p>

Generators running on diesel fuel can run for up to 30,000 hours before needing maintenance, while gas-powered generators may run only 10,000 hours before needing a checkup.</p>
