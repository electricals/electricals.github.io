<p>One of the easiest and most affordable ways to enhance the beauty of your home, while increasing safety, is to install low voltage outdoor path lighting. Unscrew the nuts and the wires should come apart easily.

Turning off the switch simply disconnects the power wire from the light fixture, cutting off power from your lights.
