Get an overview of the care that needs to be taken when using electricity, the proper way to plug in appliances, and what to do if fuses blows or circuit breakers trip. Once you are settled in your home and spending some quiet time out on your back deck or patio take some time in the evening to imagine what your back yard or garden area would look night after nightfall if you had some strategically placed lighting incorporated into your landscape and other areas and do not forget to think about adding some additional or different deck lights and lighting surrounding the areas close to the house.</p>

A breaker box or a fuse panel in need of repair or replacement is no exception to this. In the case of FPE, they lost their UL listing when it was discovered their breakers would not necessarily trip when they needed to.
