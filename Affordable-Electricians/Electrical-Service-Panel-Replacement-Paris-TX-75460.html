<p>To properly troubleshoot an electric circuit, you must know how each electrical component in the unit should function and be able to evaluate the performance of each component. Other low-voltage wiring system transformers feature timers to turn the lights off and on at designated times. As a customer-focused company, we take the time to discuss your specific lighting needs, the timeline, and your budget. Power surges can often come as a result of storms during hurricane season, but they can occur every day from other grid disruptions.

TIP: If the wires to the power source are "plugged" into the back, then you can gently rock the power source back-and-fourth until they come free.</p>
