When it comes to electricity, there are two main dangers: shocks and fires. This is a fabric- and rubber-insulated multi-strand electrical wire.</p>

Otherwise, frequent wiring issues, burnt bulbs, and other electrical problems that arise from faulty installations may burn a hole in your pocket.</p>
