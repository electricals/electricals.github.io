Lighting work requires a specific set of skills and the required knowledge. Also, there is licensing for installers that completed a course in electricity, have 1 year of working experience, and complete an exam.

<p>The cost of a generator is roughly equivalent to the amount of power it puts out, so in order to get the best value it is important to start by assessing how much power you will actually need. Our outdoor LED lamps use a fraction of the amount of energy consumed by halogen or incandescent light bulbs, and won't need to be replaced for at least 5 years.
