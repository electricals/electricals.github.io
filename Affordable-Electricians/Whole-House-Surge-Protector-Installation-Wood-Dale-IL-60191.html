<p>Gasoline can't be stored for very long, so consider a portable diesel generator if you intent to keep a portable generator around for emergencies. Due to the fact that it involves working so closely with electrical wires, any work involving your circuit breaker panel requires the assistance of qualified and experienced electricians. Not manufactured since the mid-1970s, these panels have design flaws that allow power to flow even when the breakers appear off.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, low-voltage DC wiring (for example, wiring for 12 volts or 24 volts DC) needs to have a bigger wire gauge, not a smaller wire gauge, than 120-volt AC wiring (assuming loads of the same wattage),‚Äù Holladay says.
