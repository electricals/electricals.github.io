<p>This wiring as pre-existing or "old-work" electrical wiring, is still described in the U.S. National Electrical Code (2005) in Article 394. Many homes built before the 1960's are powered by electrical panels that are equipped with fuses. Fuse boxes are not as much of a concern as the fuses that you have to put in them. Also, do not touch electrical appliances with wet hands. Spot lights can be angled and used with shrouds to direct the light exactly where desired.</p>

Because low voltage fluorescent light fittings have a lower power consumption than incandescent or halogens this makes them more desirable.
