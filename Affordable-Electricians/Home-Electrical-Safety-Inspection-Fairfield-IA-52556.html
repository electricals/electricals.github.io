The Simutech Training System is accessible by browser, with the following minimum system requirements: Windows 10 or Mac OS; i5 with U620 Intel graphics; 8GB RAM; 1366 x 768 display; Chrome, Firefox or new Microsoft Edge with Chrome; 5Mbps down, 1Mbps up reliable continuous internet; Internet ping times of < 50 ms.</p>
<p>That do not have a grounding prong to protect against falling objects bridging hot and neutral. Optical isolation uses an LED (Light Emitting Device) and a photosensitive transistor to transfer data across the isolation barrier - typically an air gap; in other words, data is transmitted using light instead of electrical signals, so there is no physical connections between the grounds and the data lines, thus removing the ground loop problems and effectively preventing electrical surges and spikes from destroying other parts of the system.</p>
