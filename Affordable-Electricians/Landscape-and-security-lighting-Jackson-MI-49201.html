The Line terminals (green arrows in photo at left) on an electrical receptacle are for the incoming hot wire - the terminal marked LINE is connected to the incoming power source or the "hot" wire (typically black or red in insulation color) that connects to the brass colored screw (marked "Black" or "Noir) at the lower left " in our photo.</p>
<p>It's also a good idea to order breaker panel replacement if your current breakers are worn out or busted. They are the whole house units and the point of use surge protectors.
