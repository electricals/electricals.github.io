<p>In-field installation costs can be higher, since SM devices are installed in series with the power feed, requiring the feed to be cut and reconnected. To save on electricity costs, attach a photocell to your transformer so the lights automatically come on at sunset and go off at sunrise. Connecting lighting fixtures to line voltage is similar to connecting a garden hose nozzle directly to the spout - not to the end of the hose. No matter the size or design of your home, landscape lighting can enhance the positives; adding style and dimension.</p>
<p>If your electrical usage is expected to go up significantly, you will need to do this upgrade.

It's imperative that the size of the wires you choose matches the amperage of the circuit.</p>

Better-quality switches and outlets may cost a dollar or two more, but they're worth it. For starters, the components are better. Any damaged or frayed wiring is means for short circuiting or residential fires. Your home relies on circuit breakers to protect its electrical system from both overloaded circuits and short circuits.</p>
<p>Flickering lights, tripped breakers and frayed wiring are tell-tale signs of needing an upgrade. Electricity also causes half of all house fires every year.

<p>Lighting Tip: You can run 12-gauge about 100 feet without voltage drop issues as long as the total wattage of the fixtures on the wire is 100 Watts or less. But when the power goes out and an electrical system fails because of a tripped breaker, faulty wire, or natural disaster, it seems as if everything stops. Because electricians must travel to different worksites, local or long distance commuting is often required. All power outlets should be earthed or grounded to prevent electric shocks.</p>
