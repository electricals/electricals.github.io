<p>There are many factors and considerations with residential wind generators which might make this energy solution the right option for you. Repairs could be minor and nominal in cost, such as the cleaning and tightening of connections or the addition of outlets, or more involved running into several thousand dollars, such as the addition of circuits and sub-panels, replacement of degraded wiring, or, particularly with older homes, a heavy-up” — that is, upgrading the electrical service from, for example, 60 amp or 100 amp service to the home to 200 amp service better able to handle today's electric demands.</p>
<p>With the correct voltage, current flows through as normal, but with a spike or surge, the device kicks-in immediately and redirects the excess.

These are in fact, certainly good reasons to pick a diesel backup generator over one that works on gasoline. They provide uninterrupted backup power for days, unlike portable generators. Neither is it designed for field use by electrical tradesmen and inspectors for testing compliance with national wiring standards.</p>
<p>If a breaker keeps tripping immediately after it's reset but the circuit's not overloaded, contact a licensed electrician immediately.
