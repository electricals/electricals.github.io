We can also assess whether the wiring in the home is sufficient and up to modern electrical codes.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for helping, I found where the main power comes from and it's hooked to the GFI that's next to the switch, so I did a pigtail of the (hot) black wire to the switch and then the other black wire that runs from the outlet from underneath the sink to the other bronze screw on the switch. Depending on application, proper installation requires meeting noise, fuel storage, building and electrical codes, and emission ordinances. Upon sensing the return to the utility power source, the generator automatically shuts down and returns to standby mode.</p>
