<p>Here's something that may surprise you: Power surges aren't always stormy, lightning-fueled events that fry your electronics. We've broken down everything you need to know about house electrical wire in this basic guide. Fasten the front cover finger plate to the back box with the fixing screws provided.

<p>You also need to make sure you get a generator that can power everything you need (if you think you'll be running central air-conditioning, which requires a lot of power, you'll likely need to get a standby generator in the 17,000- to 20,000-watt range, for example), says Hoch.

One popular and ideal place to install these landscape lights would be a part of the garden that is characterized by subdued conversation and intimate gatherings.</p>
