<p>Being able to use your yard or garden after the sun goes down can help you get a lot more enjoyment out of it. If you are like most people, you probably work during the day.

Spaces where track or cove lighting is not an option with traditional lighting systems may now feature these types of lighting. Furthermore, solar panels bring the availability of light to areas where the electrical power grid is not accessible, opening up numerous possibilities.</p>
