One option you can choose is to go with taller fixtures, these can be great because if it's in your initial design, these lights can throw out a lot of light to surrounding areas and reflect off of a lot of different textures and surfaces.</p>
<p>The Power Meter: The power meter, sometimes referred to as the energy meter, or electricity reader, is either located on the electrical panel itself, or somewhere near it. This measures the property's use of electricity, in a unit of measurement called a kilowatt hour (kWh).

The service panel is the point that connects your electrical system to the wiring that comes from outside the property. A surge protects the appliances from the TV to the small lines such as that of telephones. Because LV lighting is LV, it is very susceptible to voltage drop problems. This may well be already done in the box, though; otherwise you would have had TWO blacks and TWO reds to each outlet so that there was a black and red, both still hot, to supply the next outlet in line.</p>
