You're in your business, and you're darn good at it. Unfortunately, that means that many (or most) electrical contractors all look the same. Generally, the more joules the better, as this means the device can handle one large surge, or multiple smaller surges, before your gear is in danger. I installed some LED tape lighting around the door of a pantry and used bell wire I think it was labeled.</p>

I will be lighting various spots in each section and running home runs back to each transformer for that section.</p>
<p>By ensuring that your home undergoes a thorough electrical inspection completed by a qualified electrician before buying, selling or remodeling a home, you can make certain your home's electrical system operates at the highest level of safety possible.
