Outdoor solar lights are a little more expensive to purchase but they are much easier to install. Electrical outlets without any protective covering over the holes of the socket pose a significant risk, particularly to young children.

However, there's one thing wrapped in plastic sheaths or hidden behind walls that can also affect the safety of your home-it's electrical wiring.</p>
<p>If one of the two circuits should be switched off by a circuit breaker (perhaps detecting a fault or overcurrent) we want the other circuit to remain on so that room occupants are less likely to be left in darkness.
