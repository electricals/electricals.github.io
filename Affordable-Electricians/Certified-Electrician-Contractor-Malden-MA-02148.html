Although it's an electrical application, low voltage lighting takes very little energy to run and is relatively safe. Keep electrical cords out of the way. If your property doesn't have an exterior ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet, essential for powering a low voltage lighting system, a licensed electrician will have to add one, which will add to the expense. Lay the lights out where you want to install them. Our residential electrical services ensure all home wiring is not only performed correctly and code … but that it will live up to current and future electrical requirements and continue to safely perform for years to come.</p>

<p>Commercial grade outlets and switches are better in every way but it's most evident in outlets.

I want some lighting out there and I have a small low-voltage lighting project in mind, similar to what show in Figure 1 - though I did consider going for a Lampadaire exterieur , or outdoor lamp post first, after seeing them in people's gardens I'm fond of the low-level light the ones in Figure 1 show.
