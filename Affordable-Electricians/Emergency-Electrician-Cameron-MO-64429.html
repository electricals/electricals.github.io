<p>While electronics are becoming almost indispensable to our daily lives they are vulnerable to power surges. Our technician will work with you to transform your home lighting arrangement to give your home an updated, modern look with LED lights.

It is recommended that you turn off your home's main circuit breaker until you determine the source of the smoke while you wait on an electrician to arrive.
