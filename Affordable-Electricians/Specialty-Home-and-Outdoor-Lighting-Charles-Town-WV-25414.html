These panels, installed in homes between 1950 and 1980, have design and manufacturing defects that can cause fires and electric shocks.

<h3>Choosing Reliable Charles Town WV Electrical Contractors</h3>
<p>At NUMBER of CIRCUITS in OLD BUILDINGS , use of zip cord or extension cord mounted on or through walls and ceilings to add lighting circuits or receptacles is improper, unsafe (a fire hazard), and is often an indication that the building does not have enough circuits for modern usage. It can instantly use LP gas or natural gas, and you can switch the type of fuel in a heartbeat by a push of a button. Sometimes, a lighting designer or a home owner will want to take advantage of voltage drop.</p>
<p>Voltage drop is a LOT more important in low-voltage systems. Because low voltage fluorescent light fittings have a lower power consumption than incandescent or halogens this makes them more desirable. In these cases, the contractor license is issued after the qualifying individual passes the exam. You know when you choose Walter Electric you are choosing a company who values integrity above all else and delivers expert electrical service above and beyond what is expected.</p>
