<p>Homes today are in more need of whole house surge protection than before. Some of the changes to restrictions that were set out in the new Part P aspect of the building regulations were seen as being controversial as under the new regulations, the undertaking of any work other than simple changes such as changing a light switch became notifiable to the local building control authority; so work such as any work in a kitchen or bathroom or work in other areas that are being re-wired will require a professional body, i.e. a trained electrician, to carry them out.</p>

Lighting can add a magical touch to an otherwise boring backyard. Let's say a homeowner is using a small space heater to buffer against the cold in an area of the home and this additional electrical load results in an over current condition on that circuit, a reliable circuit breaker recognizes what is happening and turns the power off by "tripping", this allows the homeowner an opportunity to investigate what has happened before any damage is done.</p>
