<p>Avoid putting extension cords under rugs or carpet and only use outdoor-rated extension cords outside. For example, if you connect the incoming "hot" wire and neutral wire to the "load" terminals on a GFCI, and if you connect wires leading to downstream electrical receptacles to the "line" terminals (these are the incorrect connections), then pushing the test button on the GFCI will not activate that device's internal trip mechanism. This lower light switch height will allow you to avoid interfering with higher-up obstructions on the wall like backsplashes or cabinetry, while still hovering four inches above the top of a standard 36-inch-tall counter.</p>
