Circuit breakers on the other hand, just need to be switched back in order to function again. The electric company, and not the electrician , must disconnect and reconnect the power line.</p>
<p>We can help you get that power with Generac , a trusted name in generators. Installing the right size gas line with proper connectors is very important to the proper function of your generator and a poorly installed gas line will prevent your generator from starting.
