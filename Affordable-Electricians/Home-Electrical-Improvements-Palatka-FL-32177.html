The capping (also made of wood) used to cover the wires and cables installed and fitted in the casing. The whole setup, which has been termed a Hydrogen on Demand system consists of a water reservoir, ( with the HHO dry cell design ) an electrolyzer also known as the HHO generator, some tubing, a few feet of wire and a couple of automotive electrical parts.</p>

It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back.
