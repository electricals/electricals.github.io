When you open an outlet, it can be useful to figure out the position of the outlet or switch in the circuit, as well as the function of each wire.</p>
<p>Cords that are frayed or damaged should be removed and replaced immediately, not spliced or taped. If you do decide to upgrade your electrical panel, the best time to do it is when you're undertaking another remodel.

I know if you are doing a complete rehab, you will want to change out lights, old and dirty light switches and receptacles with many coats of paint, but if you can clean them up, you are better off.</p>
