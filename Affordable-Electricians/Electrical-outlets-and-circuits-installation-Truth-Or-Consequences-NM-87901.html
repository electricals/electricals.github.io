Have not less than 12,000 hours of experience obtained over a period of not less than 6 years related to electrical construction, the maintenance of buildings, or electrical wiring or equipment under the supervision of a master electrician or equivalent experience as determined by the Electrical Administrative Board. You should also be able to explain how each type of circuit breaker extinguishes an arc, and you should be able to describe basic procedures for racking out high-voltage circuit breakers and performing routine maintenance and testing on them.</p>
<p>Be sure to check the UL rating of the fixtures you are interested in. While all of the landscape lights in this assortment are save to use outdoors, some are available as damp-rated (they are safe to be exposed to water occasionally) and others are wet-rated (they can be exposed to any amount of water without harm).
