Green or bare copper are ground wires. To sum up, whether you need light fixtures installed or replaced, or lighting problems fixed, such as a loose wire in the socket, a tripped breaker and a blown fuse, as well as have circuit path issues addressed, we've got you covered. Water conducts electricity, and you could get an electric shock. Use extreme caution whenever you're working on the electrical system, and if you are not confident about doing the job safely, contact a qualified, licensed electrician.</p>
