Check electric cords for fraying or cracking. Position Lights - Position the landscape lights and cable above the ground where you want them fitted. An electrician is someone who specializes in the wiring and repair of electrical mechanisms. If there is no power, the breaker is faulty and requires replacement.</p>

It is designed for closer placement near the house as you can have it as close as 18 inches from your house which can cut down on the installation cost. Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
<p>Each 120-volt circuit has a black or color wire connected to a circuit breaker or fuse; the white wire is connected to the neutral bus bar. For outdoor lights, it is best to choose one that has low wattage to save energy and to avoid lights that are too bright that make your garden look garish and tacky. When you shop for surge protection, you are quickly going to notice that there are many out there to choose from. Keep all surge protectors away from moisture of any kind.</p>
