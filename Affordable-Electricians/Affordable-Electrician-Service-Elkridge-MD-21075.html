Hydrangeas love landscape lighting,” says Dross of Kichler Lighting They should be stage actors.” They reflect light dramatically when they're in flower, but they also create dancing shadows in winter because they retain their faded leaves and blooms. However, the higher production cost would mean that the price for setting up a series of landscape lighting fixtures would cost more than using traditional lighting methods and materials.</p>
<p>Remember that power strips only add outlets—they do not change the amount of power the outlet receives. You will, of course, need an already existing outlet that is half switched or will need to add a switch yourself. Neatly fold the wires into the box in this order: grounds, neutrals and then hots.

<p>Unless the generator includes a transfer switch when you purchase it you'll need to pick one up separately. If any wires are doubled up on one side of the light switch, meaning more than one wire under one screw or stab-hole, twist those two wires together and tail off with a single lead wire just like the receptacles. The inspection will help identify problems like frequently blowing fuses or tripping circuit breakers, loose connections at outlets, older and deteriorated wiring, and outdated and overburdened electrical service.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you do not have the wire necessary in the box to make a half hot - the permanent hot is missing and only the switched hot is available.
