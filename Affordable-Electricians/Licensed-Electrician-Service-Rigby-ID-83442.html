<p>Surge Protection Devices or SPDs are designed to protect electrical equipment from Transient Overvoltages and they are becoming more commonly used in electrical installations. Do insert cord plugs fully into the power outlet. When you consider that every year around 6700 fires are reported as having an electrical source, you can see just how important electrical safety really is.

The National Electric Code (NEC) updates electrical codes and standards for outlets and wiring every three years. So, mix it up, and use different types of landscape lighting. Or it can happen if someone in a nearby factory switches on or off a huge appliance with a powerful electric motor inside it, which might cause a sudden surge or drop in power in the whole circuit in your home.</p>
<p>Use only outdoor lights, fixtures and extension cords. At Ryan Electrical Services, our electricians can troubleshoot your home generator in order to ensure that it is operating effectively and efficiently. If possible, a drawing of the area and the objects for lighting should be sent to the technicians in advance for proper recommendations on installation. We did this by optimizing it for lighting applications, which rarely use a grounding prong and are the most common devices that are turned on and off with wall switches.</p>

<p>If one of the two circuits should be switched off by a circuit breaker (perhaps detecting a fault or overcurrent) we want the other circuit to remain on so that room occupants are less likely to be left in darkness. However, this requires electrical contractors to take some steps in areas they are less used to: on top of skillsets with regards to electricity, they need skillsets with regards to essential IT and IoT know-how. With rapidly advancing landscape lighting technologies, a lot of homes (even less than a decade old) have landscape lighting systems that are out of date.</p>
