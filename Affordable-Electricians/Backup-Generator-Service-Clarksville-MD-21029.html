<p>If the light switch is in the on position, and you touch the wrong parts of the light bulb, while removing and replacing it, you could find yourself getting a nice jolt of electricity through your body. If you have electronics plugged into power strips, make sure they have surge protection as well (not all power strips do!). Circuit breakers are designed to trip when overloaded or when there is a short circuit or electrical problem.

The number, color, and function of the wires at an outlet can be confusing if the original connections are lost track of. Whether the attachment method chosen is screws, push-in holes, or pigtailing with wire connectors, enough insulation must be stripped off the wire for good metal-to-metal contact, and wires should be tugged on to check tightness.</p>
<p>Portable generators are more reasonably priced, starting at about $300, but they tend to be substantially less powerful and don't turn on automatically when the power goes out.
