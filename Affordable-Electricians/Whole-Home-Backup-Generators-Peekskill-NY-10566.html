<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician in Peekskill</h2>

The transformer is a 10 to 1 ratio transformer with a maximum secondary wattage of 300 watts at 12 volts.</p>

<p>As briefly explained above, the black wires are the power (or hot”) wires and the white wires are the neutral (or return”) wires. Someone turns the lights ON at switch #1. Attach the positive wire from the transformer to the low-voltage light's positive wire and the neutral wire to the the light's neutral with twist-on wire connectors. Utility - Lighting that fulfills this requirement is usually going to be used to light a walkway or driveway, or some other outdoor structure such as a carport or shed.</p>
