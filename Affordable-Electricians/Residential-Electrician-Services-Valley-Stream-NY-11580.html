<p>If your home does not have landscape lighting, there are two very good reasons why you should consider installing some. This poses danger to your bathroom electrical wiring, so it is best to install an exhaust fan so that air can circulate inside the bathroom space and no steam or moisture will build up inside. 2. LED lighting greatly reduces maintenance costs. Even for larger homes with more circuits, the cost increase is insignificant compared to the total cost of the home, particularly when the increased level of safety is factored. PowerTech Electrical Services is proud to be a leading residential electrical contractor and service provider serving Durham, Raleigh, Cary, and the greater Triangle.</p>

Slip the wires through the holes on the transformer and tighten the screws over the wire.</p>
<p>Task lighting is used to focus on areas you will be working in. Enclosed fixtures are typically found in halls, bedrooms & bathrooms.
