I have installed 1,000's of outdoor lighting systems for almost 30 years now, primarily 12 volt Garden lighting. Once the energy audit is complete, the electrician lays out a list of recommendations. Proper identification of the type of electrical wire and wire insulation is useful for those seeking to guess at the age of a building or of its electrical system, and in some instances it is helpful in assessing the condition and safety of the building wiring system, such as taking note of the presence of branch circuit solid conductor aluminum electrical wire that has not been properly repaired - a fire hazard.</p>
