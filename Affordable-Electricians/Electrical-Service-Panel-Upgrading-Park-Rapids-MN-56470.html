The whole setup, which has been termed a Hydrogen on Demand system consists of a water reservoir, ( with the HHO dry cell design ) an electrolyzer also known as the HHO generator, some tubing, a few feet of wire and a couple of automotive electrical parts.</p>
<p>The above wiring circuit was made using only a two conductor cable with ground. This training enables them to become journeyman electricians.
