Residential Electrical Contractor: You must hold a license as a Class A or B Master electrician or Residential Master electrician. All electrical items used in and around water (i.e. in the kitchen, bathroom, or wet areas in the basement) should be locked away from children. Portable generators powered by natural gas or propane is the best choice if available.

Some electricians may eventually pursue careers as drafter, elevator installers, and line repairers.

<p>Avoid putting extension cords under rugs or carpet and only use outdoor-rated extension cords outside. For example, if you connect the incoming "hot" wire and neutral wire to the "load" terminals on a GFCI, and if you connect wires leading to downstream electrical receptacles to the "line" terminals (these are the incorrect connections), then pushing the test button on the GFCI will not activate that device's internal trip mechanism.

When electrical work needs to be carried out within your home it is important that you hire a professional to do it as electrical work that is installed unprofessionally could end up being dangerous and you and your home could be what ends up suffering as a result of it.
