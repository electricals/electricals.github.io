<p>Make sure all outdoor outlets are equipped with ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) to help prevent electric shock. If an electric gadget gets wet, do not touch it or unplug it. First, switch the electricity off at the circuit breaker panel, then unplug it. Wait for it to dry out completely before using it again.

Our trained electricians carry out even the most complicated residential electrical services in a professional manner. With a transfer switch, our team of electrical contractors will connect your generator to the panel, which will automatically connect to all the electrical wiring in your home. That's only necessary if you did NOT separate the white wires.
