<p>Sometimes, even the most eye-pleasing outdoor arrangements cannot be fully appreciated in the daytime especially when the sun is up and about. Having a standby generator in your home means you can keep the lights on when the power goes out. Surge protectors should always have a polarized plug (with one of the blades larger than the other) or a three-prong grounded plug. Whatever you do, don't overload your plugs or extension cords. There may be other wires in the box, but you are only dealing with the ones connected directly to the switch.
