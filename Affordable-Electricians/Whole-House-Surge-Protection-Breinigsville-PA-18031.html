Upgrading your electric panel ensures that all of your new appliances are supported and that your family and home are safe from any dangers that might occur from overloading your system. Flickering lights are a sign that a home is very old, and the panel was designed for about 60 amps of electricity. If you have loose electrical sockets or frayed wires protruding from the wall, you should have the issues fixed by a trained electrician. If yours are overloaded with too many plugs, consider having a qualified electrician install additional outlets.</p>
<p>When you use anything in your home that requires electricity, it must first go through the breaker panel. In a typical electrical code , some colour-coding of wires is mandatory.

<p>Electrical outlets require the right tools and components to ensure safe and fully operational results.
