One of the simplest electrical safety tips is also one of the easiest to forget: when an appliance is not in use, unplug it. Not only does this save you power by reducing any phantom drain (the amount of energy the device consumes even when not actively in use), but unplugging unused appliances also protects them from overheating or power surges. The auxiliary contacts are then available for use in the control circuit of the original machine or another machine.</p>
<p>Commercial grade outlets and switches are better in every way but it's most evident in outlets. Wiring for these types of garden lights must be buried at a depth of 18 inches or encased in conduit to protect it from water.
