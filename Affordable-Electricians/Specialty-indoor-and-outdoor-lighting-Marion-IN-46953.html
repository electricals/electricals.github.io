It's basically going to cap the output at a certain wattage or voltage of electricity and return any unwanted electricity back into the home circuit loop. The number, color, and function of the wires at an outlet can be confusing if the original connections are lost track of. Whether the attachment method chosen is screws, push-in holes, or pigtailing with wire connectors, enough insulation must be stripped off the wire for good metal-to-metal contact, and wires should be tugged on to check tightness.</p>
