<p>Our method of installing switches and plugs is different from the methods used in new construction and takes more time, however you will never have problems caused by loose connections in the devices. Every Portland home needs to be outfitted with an entire home surge protector. If anything looks discolored, burned, or melted, turn off the power at your breaker box and call a qualified electrician immediately. While smart switches take a little more effort to install, they keep outlets available and can control more than one bulb.</p>

Older homes with ungrounded outlets or homes with improper wiring and grounding will not be helped by a surge protector without the necessary upgrades. The electrician arrived on time and performed the work efficiently and professionally. Look for sparks or scorch marks when you plug electrical equipment into outlets.
