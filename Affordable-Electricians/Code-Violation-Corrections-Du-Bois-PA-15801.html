<p>Malfunctioning Electrical Panel: Remember that an electrical panel is the root of your home's electric system. Most landscape architects will include a lighting scheme with their design. When mounting a light switch over a countertop—for example, in an indoor or outdoor kitchen, an art studio, or a craft room—reduce the standard wall mounting height to 40 inches.
