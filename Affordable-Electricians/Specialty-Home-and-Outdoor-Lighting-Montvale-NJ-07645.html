Green or bare copper are ground wires. To sum up, whether you need light fixtures installed or replaced, or lighting problems fixed, such as a loose wire in the socket, a tripped breaker and a blown fuse, as well as have circuit path issues addressed, we've got you covered. Water conducts electricity, and you could get an electric shock.

Many surge protectors come with USB connections, so you can charge your mobile devices without having to use a their wall warts. By updating the panel and getting experienced advice on the state of your wiring, you can rest assured that your home's electrical system is safe.
