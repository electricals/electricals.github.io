The Consumer Product Safety Commision estimates that 50 people die every year from accidental electrocutions involving residential wiring, panel boards, circuit breakers, and electrical outlets.</p>
<p>For instance, instead of 14 AWG ( American wire gauge ) copper wire, aluminium wiring would need to be 12 AWG on a typical 15 ampere lighting circuit, though local building codes vary. It's also worth considering the placement of light switches if family members are getting older or have lost mobility and would have trouble reaching a switch while seated in a wheelchair.
