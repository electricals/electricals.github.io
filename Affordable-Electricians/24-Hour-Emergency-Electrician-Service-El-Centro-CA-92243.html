Instead, splice the neutrals from the feed to the GFCI and the under-sink outlet together, splice a short jumper to the black feed to the GFCI, and connect that jumper to a new switch.

<p>1) Quality spike protection strips have a light or lights that indicate when or not the unit is safeguarding your equipment.
