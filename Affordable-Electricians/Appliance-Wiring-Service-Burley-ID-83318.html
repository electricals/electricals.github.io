Applications for examination must be approved by the State Electrical Board. Here are a few tips concerning the potential hazards associated with your switches and outlets.

Advances in Electrical Safety Codes throughout the years. Newer outlets have a third opening where the third prong of a plug can go in. As with the light switch, there is a grounding terminal located on the end of the outlet which connects the third prong of the plug to the grounding circuit. NEC 411.2 provides the definition for low-voltage lighting systems and states that one or more power supply secondary low-voltage circuits are permissible but each circuit is limited to 25 amperes maximum with a maximum voltage of 30 volts, ac or dc.</p>
