As with the light switch, there is a grounding terminal located on the end of the outlet which connects the third prong of the plug to the grounding circuit. NEC 411.2 provides the definition for low-voltage lighting systems and states that one or more power supply secondary low-voltage circuits are permissible but each circuit is limited to 25 amperes maximum with a maximum voltage of 30 volts, ac or dc.</p>
