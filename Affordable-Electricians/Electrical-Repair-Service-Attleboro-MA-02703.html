To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>

Electricians usually must complete a minimum number of continuing education hours every year to maintain their license, as well as periodically pass another examination. When power is restored, the transfer switch shuts off the generator. Low voltage lighting is shockless and safe to use around children and pets.
