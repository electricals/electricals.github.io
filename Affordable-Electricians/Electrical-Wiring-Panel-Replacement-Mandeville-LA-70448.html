As a rule, light fixtures that have lasted for about three decades (25 years plus) in any given building is prone to unstable power supply.

In musical concerts or stage plays, for example, it is an electrician that is needed in setting up temporary lightings on the stage.</p>

Also, don't touch electrical equipment, including light switches and power cords, with wet or damp hands.
