<p>There are many reasons that we need a backup power generator at home. Consult an electrician to learn whether your home's panel is still capable of providing the electricity you need or whether it's time to consider an upgrade. As a general rule houses are not supplied with enough power sockets or switches for additional lighting.

Always use ladders made with non-conductive side rails (e.g., fibreglass) when working with or near electricity or power lines.</p>
<p>If the power is in the receptacle box, use a 3 wire cable between receptacle box and switch box.

This isn't too surprising, as being an electrician often means crouching, kneeling and bending to reach the electrical installations you're supposed to be working on.
