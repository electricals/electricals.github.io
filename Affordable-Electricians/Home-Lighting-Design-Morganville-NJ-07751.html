Electricians in Indiana do not need to hold a state license. Identified by their gray or painted metal box, electric panels are usually mounted in rooms such as the garage, closet, laundry room, and even outside of your home. Our highly trained, background checked, and drug tested electricians have performed countless panel replacements and can handle any type or model.
