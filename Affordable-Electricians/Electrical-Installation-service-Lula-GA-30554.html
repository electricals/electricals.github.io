Perhaps your competitors have a formula for how to run a successful electrical business that's more potent than yours. Never attempt electrical repairs or rewiring without proper certification and experience. At a minimum, loose wires can cause a receptacle or switch to stop working.

<p>For example, devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners require large amounts of energy to switch motors and compressors on and off, creating surges in power that disrupt the steady flow of voltage. A good rule of thumb is to treat all wires as if they're live, so first connect the ground wire, then neutral wire, then load, and lastly hot. Yago recommends running your portable generator for about a half hour every few months. Electrical Contractors are not issued with a plastic licence card but are issued with a Certificate of Registration.</p>
