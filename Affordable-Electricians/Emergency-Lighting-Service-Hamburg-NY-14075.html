<p>The State Electrical Safety program is achieved through the adoption of nationally recognized safety codes, licensing, education, training of people doing electrical installation work and code enforcement, which reduces the risk of fire and electrocutions. Although it's an electrical application, low voltage lighting takes very little energy to run and is relatively safe. Keep electrical cords out of the way. If your property doesn't have an exterior ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet, essential for powering a low voltage lighting system, a licensed electrician will have to add one, which will add to the expense. Lay the lights out where you want to install them. Our residential electrical services ensure all home wiring is not only performed correctly and code … but that it will live up to current and future electrical requirements and continue to safely perform for years to come.</p>
<p>The solar powered lights are definitely the most popular type of landscape light fixture as it pays for itself by how much you save on your electric bill. Remember the notion that "less is more" - and apply this to your garden lighting. Lighting repairs are an important part of the look and feel of a Los Angeles County home.

Around 10 watts of power running through halogen bulbs gives you complete control over your deck lighting needs.
