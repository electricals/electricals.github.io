Our power grid could not function without it. And there are many electrical devices, like pumps, that need high voltage to operate. As a rule, light fixtures that have lasted for about three decades (25 years plus) in any given building is prone to unstable power supply. A half-hot (or switched) outlet is a duplex outlet that has one half permanently "on" or ready to provide electricity while the other half can be turned off and on via an ordinary wall switch.</p>
