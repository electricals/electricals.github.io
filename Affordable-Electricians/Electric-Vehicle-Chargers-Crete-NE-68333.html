Getting a propane-powered portable generator is a smarter solution. Fuses can pose an electrical fire hazard, and you may have trouble acquiring insurance for your home if you don't get them upgraded. The 2008 National Electric Code (NEC) requires AFCI breakers for circuits leading to bedroom, living room and family room.</p>
<p>Report any broken poles or trees on the power line or any downed electric lines to NOVEC or the police immediately. The journeyman electrician exam will determine whether or not electrician training has been fruitful. If your house still contains a fuse panel, you should upgrade to a standard breaker panel.

If your home is older, it may have a fused-based electrical system.</p>
