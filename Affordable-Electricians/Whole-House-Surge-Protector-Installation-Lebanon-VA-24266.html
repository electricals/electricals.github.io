If you want the switch to control the light it's currently connected to, but also control the included outlet—like if you're using a lamp in tandem with overhead lights—here's how to wire it up.</p>
<p>In order to know the gauge of the wire and the circuit information, you'll have to check the cable-sheath labeling. Watch out: if the "hot" wire in your light switch is on a 3-way circuit you may not always have power at your add-on receptacle.

BBA was founded in 1980 by RÃ©jean Breton and Jean-Louis Banville who wanted to provide engineering expertise and cutting-edge solutions for all types of clients. The first lesson you need to learn about landscape lighting aside from knowing what are the best outdoor lights is that in many cases, less is more. Try to find out where the electrical wires are before drilling into the walls, especially around the power points and light switches.</p>
<p>Unless the generator includes a transfer switch when you purchase it you'll need to pick one up separately. If any wires are doubled up on one side of the light switch, meaning more than one wire under one screw or stab-hole, twist those two wires together and tail off with a single lead wire just like the receptacles. The inspection will help identify problems like frequently blowing fuses or tripping circuit breakers, loose connections at outlets, older and deteriorated wiring, and outdated and overburdened electrical service.</p>

<p>Lights flickering, warm to the touch receptacles, and any noticeable odor such as, the smell of burning plastic should be inspected by a licensed electrician. The power is reliably there and immediately so. Connecting lighting fixtures to low voltage is similar to connecting a garden hose nozzle to the end of a garden hose.

Otherwise, frequent wiring issues, burnt bulbs, and other electrical problems that arise from faulty installations may burn a hole in your pocket.</p>
