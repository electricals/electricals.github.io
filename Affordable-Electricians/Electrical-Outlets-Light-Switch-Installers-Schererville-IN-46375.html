<p>For instance, instead of 14 AWG ( American wire gauge ) copper wire, aluminium wiring would need to be 12 AWG on a typical 15 ampere lighting circuit, though local building codes vary. It's also worth considering the placement of light switches if family members are getting older or have lost mobility and would have trouble reaching a switch while seated in a wheelchair. A digital timer may be used for more complex lighting systems where multiple start times are required including start times on different days of the week.</p>
<p>A typical surge protector passes current along from an outlet to several electronic and electrical devices that are plugged into the power strip.

<p>Circuit breakers are designed to trip or cut-off power to the circuit when more amps are being drawn than the wire is rated to carry. Consider the power savings of LED bulbs to save money over time. You want to replace a half hot outlet with a switch (dimmer) to run some LED lights. Cutting through cables, drilling into wiring in the walls and trying to effect a repair while the appliance is still plugged in are just some of the causes of fatal electric shocks that occur each year in homes.</p>

That's where your circuit breaker is located, and your panel is what houses the wiring and equipment.
