<p>With in-depth expertise in the delivery, use and control of energized facility systems, our engineers and technicians test and troubleshoot components and systems for utilities, mission critical facilities, electrical equipment manufacturers, and electrical design firms. Our power grid could not function without it. And there are many electrical devices, like pumps, that need high voltage to operate. As a rule, light fixtures that have lasted for about three decades (25 years plus) in any given building is prone to unstable power supply. A half-hot (or switched) outlet is a duplex outlet that has one half permanently "on" or ready to provide electricity while the other half can be turned off and on via an ordinary wall switch.</p>
<p>Turn the breaker on to test the outlet and, if it works, turn the breaker off and secure the outlet back into the wall. No, not having a ground on the switch won't make the outlet fail to work. Power surges can be caused by lightning strikes or fluctuations in the electrical grid.
