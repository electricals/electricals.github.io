<p>These indoor units are manufactured with secondary input connections that are compatible with wiring methods from NEC chapter 3, such as those that include ½ inch knockouts or NM cable clamp, permitting compliance with 411.4. Section 411.4 states that low-voltage lighting systems must not be concealed or the wiring must not extend through a building wall, unless using a wiring method specified in chapter 3. The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
<p>However, self-installation and self-repair can be both dangerous and confusing. Because multiple devices (nodes) are connected, the ground potential at different nodes could be different, which can cause ground currents to flow through "the path of least resistance" via either the common earth ground or the ground wire.
