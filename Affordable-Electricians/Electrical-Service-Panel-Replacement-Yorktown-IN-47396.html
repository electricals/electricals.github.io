<p>A surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting to ground any unwanted voltages above a safe threshold.

<p>Outlets that are improperly installed can cause your circuit breaker to trip frequently. Your home is divided into various electrical zones, each of which has a circuit particular to your electrical needs in that area. Your electrical panel box is a series of wires and breakers that dictate where power goes in your home or business and how much goes to each location. This type of wire is the foundation, or start, to all of the electrical cables I will discuss with you in this article.</p>
