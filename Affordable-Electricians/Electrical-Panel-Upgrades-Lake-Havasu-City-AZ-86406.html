<p>EC&M ranks the biggest electrical contracting companies of the year. As a homeowner, it's wise to know where the breaker panel in your house is located in the case of an emergency or the sudden need to cut off or restore power. Since Georgia is faced with a substantial amount of thunderstorms each year, surge protection is a concern for every Georgia homeowner and consumer. Too few switches, outlets and lights.

Jameson electrical technicians will safely repair or upgrade your home's electric main service panel. Our team of licensed electricians also handle generator repair and maintenance to ensure that your unit is functioning properly at all times.</p>
