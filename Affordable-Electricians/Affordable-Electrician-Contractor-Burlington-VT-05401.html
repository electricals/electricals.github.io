An electrical panel that contains fuses should be replaced immediately. From a tight spot to a significantly wider spread the Coastal Source Bullet Lights are ideal fixtures that will grow with the ever changing natural palette of your landscape. In summary, do not assume that because a generator is portable it does not require the safety net provided by a professionally installed transfer switch.</p>
