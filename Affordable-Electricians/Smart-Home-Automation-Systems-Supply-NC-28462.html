<p>While electronics are becoming almost indispensable to our daily lives they are vulnerable to power surges. Our technician will work with you to transform your home lighting arrangement to give your home an updated, modern look with LED lights. Not all rubber insulated copper wire is plated, but if you suspect that the silvery-colored wire is plated copper, it's easy enough to determine: with the wire disconnected from any power source, scratch the silver colored surface of the rubber-insulated wire and you'll see its red copper interior. If you go a long period without needing your portable backup generator, you may spend a lot of money on gasoline you cannot use.</p>
