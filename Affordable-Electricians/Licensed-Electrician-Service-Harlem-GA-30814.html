Above we see both older fabric-covered electrical conductors and newer plastic-insulated wires in an electrical panel. Rather than attending school to gain a degree, electricians get their education on-the-job. The main electrical panel is the heart of your home's electrical system, and your distribution point for all the electric circuits in your home. Using a single outlet protector will dampen the surge and protect electronic parts on the appliance. These black wires go on to the bronze side, and if you notice on the other side, you have white wires.</p>
<p>You don't want to hire someone who has outlandish prices, but at the same time, you don't want to sacrifice quality for price, especially when it comes to electrical wiring. Or, complete 12,000 hours in electrical installations along with passing an exam.

<p>If your two plug ins (two electrical receptacles) are located in the same electrical box (we call this a "quad" electrical receptacle installation since each individual receptacle provides connections for two wall plugs), you'll want to wire the hot and neutral to one pair of screws on the first receptacle, and use short black and white jumper wires to connect the the proper terminals on the first receptacle to the second one in the same box. If the outlets ARE half hot, with one half of it switched, it will not be possible to reproduce that with the new outlets.</p>
