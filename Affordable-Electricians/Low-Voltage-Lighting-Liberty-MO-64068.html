Our technician will work with you to transform your home lighting arrangement to give your home an updated, modern look with LED lights. Not all rubber insulated copper wire is plated, but if you suspect that the silvery-colored wire is plated copper, it's easy enough to determine: with the wire disconnected from any power source, scratch the silver colored surface of the rubber-insulated wire and you'll see its red copper interior. If you go a long period without needing your portable backup generator, you may spend a lot of money on gasoline you cannot use.</p>
<p>The range of electrical sockets and switches are useful in protecting from unexpected shocks and surges. Wired remote control of lighting switches is also possible using, for example, X10 signaling over the power wires. Choose to run your home generator on gas or propane for whole house power or just the essentials. Outdoor lighting, including pathway lights, landscape spotlights, landscape flood lights, deck and step lights and bollards, can be both practically functional and can add to the overall aesthetic of your home.</p>
<p>In cases where multiple fixtures are needed, it is important to consider low voltage or LED landscape lighting as a greener and more energy-efficient solution. The ground wire can be continuous, tying the two ground screws on the receptacles together and onwards to the circuit ground. Your new generator will have a fuel source connected directly to the generator and if it is natural gas, there is nothing to refill as it is delivered to your Bay Area home consistantly.</p>
