<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician in West Grove</h2>
<p>Are you remodeling your home and need to install new lighting? The tasks involve troubleshooting for electrical faults, replacing faulty wires or other components such as light switches, electrical outlets and breaker boxes.

<p>If your two plug ins (two electrical receptacles) are located in the same electrical box (we call this a "quad" electrical receptacle installation since each individual receptacle provides connections for two wall plugs), you'll want to wire the hot and neutral to one pair of screws on the first receptacle, and use short black and white jumper wires to connect the the proper terminals on the first receptacle to the second one in the same box. If the outlets ARE half hot, with one half of it switched, it will not be possible to reproduce that with the new outlets.</p>
