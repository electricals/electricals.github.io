<p>The difference between a lighting installation and a thermostat or phone is the power consumption and possibility of overheating. It's usually a small unit and has only one voltage available, so you will have some effect from "voltage drop" - a kind of line loss that occurs from fixture to fixture or over any amount of wire distance.
