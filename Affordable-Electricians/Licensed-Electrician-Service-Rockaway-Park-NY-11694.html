<p>Therefore, in addition to electrical and fire safety concerns, such cables may also be required to be pressure-resistant where they penetrate a vessel's bulkheads. Although you can create a system of lights that runs on standard 120 voltage from your house, for a DIY installation it's recommended that you use a low 12-volt system for safety and cost.
