<p>The range of electrical sockets and switches are useful in protecting from unexpected shocks and surges. Wired remote control of lighting switches is also possible using, for example, X10 signaling over the power wires.

Outdoor lighting, including pathway lights, landscape spotlights, landscape flood lights, deck and step lights and bollards, can be both practically functional and can add to the overall aesthetic of your home.</p>

When you wire the new outlet only hook up the "hot" wire to the outlet, not the switched wire. Older wire could be aluminum or copper-clad aluminum.</p>
