<p>Buying computer surge protectors seems simple enough, right? When purchasing or building a new home, lighting installation is often the least of your priorities. A grounding wire is connected separately to each outlet and then is connected to the bottom of the breaker box. Why not extend the landscape lighting to the exterior surfaces of the home as well. And be aware that generators can go through gas pretty quickly—even a portable generator can use more than five gallons a day.
