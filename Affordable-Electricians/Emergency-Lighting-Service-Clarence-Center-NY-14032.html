<p>EC&M ranks the biggest electrical contracting companies of the year. As a homeowner, it's wise to know where the breaker panel in your house is located in the case of an emergency or the sudden need to cut off or restore power. Since Georgia is faced with a substantial amount of thunderstorms each year, surge protection is a concern for every Georgia homeowner and consumer. Too few switches, outlets and lights. Either way, the only method of making it a half hot - half switched and half unswitched - is to run another wire to it. Relocate cords instead of overloading outlets.</p>
<p>If the light switch is in the on position, and you touch the wrong parts of the light bulb, while removing and replacing it, you could find yourself getting a nice jolt of electricity through your body. If you have electronics plugged into power strips, make sure they have surge protection as well (not all power strips do!). Circuit breakers are designed to trip when overloaded or when there is a short circuit or electrical problem. Use a portable ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) cord if your outdoor outlets don't have GFCIs.</p>
