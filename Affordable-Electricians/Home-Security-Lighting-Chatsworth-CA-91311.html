Hydrangeas love landscape lighting,” says Dross of Kichler Lighting They should be stage actors.” They reflect light dramatically when they're in flower, but they also create dancing shadows in winter because they retain their faded leaves and blooms.

Landscape lighting describes a large and varied family of outdoor lighting fixtures. Even though surge protectors are well-suited for adding outlets in a concentrated area like behind a media center, you should never daisy-chain multiple power strips, or use them to power high-output devices like space heaters, air-conditioners or hair dryers. When you open an outlet, it can be useful to figure out the position of the outlet or switch in the circuit, as well as the function of each wire.</p>
