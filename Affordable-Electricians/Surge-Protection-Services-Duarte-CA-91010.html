You're in your business, and you're darn good at it. Unfortunately, that means that many (or most) electrical contractors all look the same. Generally, the more joules the better, as this means the device can handle one large surge, or multiple smaller surges, before your gear is in danger. I installed some LED tape lighting around the door of a pantry and used bell wire I think it was labeled.</p>

You should use safety procedures and practices that insulate you from electricity's power anytime you work with or near electrical equipment or components.
