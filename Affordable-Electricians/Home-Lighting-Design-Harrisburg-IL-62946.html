Westinghouse WPro8500 is comparatively quieter than many other generators of this size. A generator can keep the lights on during a blackout—but only if it's been properly installed by a licensed electrician. The cables are run on wooden batten and fixed by means of link clips just as in TRS wiring. Not all landscape lighting fixtures are created equal.</p>
