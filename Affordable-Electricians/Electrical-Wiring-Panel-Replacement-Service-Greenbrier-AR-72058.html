<p>The generators return to standby mode automatically when no longer needed. A hardscape fixture under the bench, coupled with deck sconces mounted to the corner posts create a soft glow. Alternatively, you could have the switch only control the light fixture, and the outlet portion remaining constantly on no matter the state of the switch.
