<p>I believe that's how it was, and yes the switch works in its updated function of controlling the ceiling lights. More than 2,000 children are in emergency rooms due to electrical burns or shocks each year. For example, let's say you have a circuit with wiring rated to handle 15 amps.

A surge protector works by channeling the extra voltage into the outlet's grounding wire, preventing it from flowing through the electronic devices while at the same time allowing the normal voltage to continue along its path. There are many different ways that a surge can find its way into your electrical system. Each panel has varying wire size and the size depends on the electrical panel installation and the size of the meter.</p>
<p>As I've stated, every year, we learn of numerous deaths and near deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning from using portable generators.

Use surge protectors, says Danny Lipford, an Alabama-based home improvement expert who dispenses advice on TV, radio and his site, Today's Homeowner These handy devices may look the same as power strips, but in addition to offering multiple outlets, he says, surge protectors divert those brief jumps in voltage to a ground line—before the harmful jolts can reach your stuff.</p>
<p>When the safety device is actuated (when the door comes in contact with an object during downward travel), the circuit will cause the motor to step and reverse the door to the fully open position. With the generator running, the switch closed, and the voltmeter probes attached to the current conductor and neutral conductor connections of the motor, the voltmeter will indicate the voltage potential at the motor. Remove the old light from its socket and remove the twist-on wire connectors securing the electrical conductors to the fixture.</p>
