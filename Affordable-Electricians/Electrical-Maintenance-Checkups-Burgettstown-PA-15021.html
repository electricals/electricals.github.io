<p>Nearly all household wire is copper, though aluminum is occasionally used. A surge protector or surge suppressor is an appliance or device designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead). If you've noticed that the electrical outlets in your home aren't working as well as they use to, or they aren't able to hold the plug, it may be time to repair or replace it. Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>

Every Portland home needs to be outfitted with an entire home surge protector.

<p>Watch out: we do not wire fixed lighting fixtures such as ceiling lights on the same circuit as electrical receptacles ("wall plugs"). But depending on how the building is wired, you may not have an acceptable neutral wire, and in some still older circuits you may not have a safe ground wire.

Decorative exterior lights add another level of sophistication to a home and landscape.

<p>Basically, electrical wires are color coded to prevent wiring errors. Low voltage lighting is less permanent than standard line voltage lighting, which is quite difficult to re-arrange. More specifically, when electrical systems are damaged in a natural or man-made disaster, electricians need to make critical decisions about whether the electrical equipment that was damaged can be salvaged or not. Otherwise, frequent wiring issues, burnt bulbs, and other electrical problems that arise from faulty installations may burn a hole in your pocket.</p>
