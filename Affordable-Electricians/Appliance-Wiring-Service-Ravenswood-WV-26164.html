We train our Los Angeles electricians to highlight the design of every building while illuminating the grounds. Garden Walls (well, bullet, or flood).Position fixtures close to the base so that the beams bring textures into sharp relief.

Low voltage landscape lighting systems uses a transformer which lowers the electrical output to the lights. Each receptacle has a 120-volt ‘hot' wire, a neutral wire and a ground.
