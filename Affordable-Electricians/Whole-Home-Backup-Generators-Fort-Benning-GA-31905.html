<p>Not having landscape lighting is like spending millions of dollars on a beautiful commissioned piece of art only to hide it in the closet.

It does add additional cost to the installation of the generator, but the peace of mind provided may be what your situation needs. Even though new NEC Article 411 was developed to cover the new low-voltage track lighting, low-voltage landscape lighting is also covered by default since they are designed and listed systems.</p>
<p>And yes, each outlet you wish to be switched will need the tab broken off. The system will automatically shed‚Äù electrical items that are less important, then put them back online when more power is available.

Use wiring that is made for outdoor use and always install weatherproof receptacles and boxes.
