Many low-voltage wiring installation manuals include a table of allowed wattages as a function of wiring distances and wire gauge. Applications for examination must be approved by the State Electrical Board. Here are a few tips concerning the potential hazards associated with your switches and outlets.

Immediately addressing the problem with your electrical panel will help you avoid emergency situations and potential issues such as power surges, electrical shocks, and circuit overloads.</p>
