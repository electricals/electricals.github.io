<p>Many protectors will connect to all three in pairs (line-neutral, line-ground and neutral-ground), because there are conditions, such as lightning, where both line and neutral have high voltage spikes that need to be shorted to ground.

<p>Whether you're a contractor or building manager, it is important to keep Class 2 compliance in mind when retrofitting or creating new construction with low voltage LED lights and systems.

All outdoor outlets should have waterproof covers.</p>
<p>Likewise, you should also think of owning a surge protector that already has circuit protection. Hundreds of tiny lightbulbs make up most LED lighting displays; these lightbulbs don't feature a filament, so they won't burn out or risk getting very hot.
