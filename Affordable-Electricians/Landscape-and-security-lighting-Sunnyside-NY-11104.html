NOTE: Working inside an electrical panel is dangerous and is best left to a professional electrician. In a kit you should find enough lights for your yard, a transformer and plenty of wire. Occasional light installation issues happen every now and then in most households. They may also be caused by birds, animals and trees interfering with power lines, auto accidents involving utility poles, neighbors using major power equipment, faulty home wiring and many other factors.</p>
<p>Turn OFF electricity at the main fuse box (or the circuit breaker box) that controls the power to the fixture or the room you're working in.
