<p>Generators are becoming more and more popular these days. Natural Gas and Propane generators can be sensitive to both fuel pressure and volume, so high-quality connections are important. Sterlite Power (as a division of STL) was awarded India's first Independent Power Transmission Project under Tariff Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) regime. As such, landscape lighting fixtures are best hidden within bushes or rock formations and properly oriented to highlight the leaves in a tall tree or wash up a textural wall.

Sometimes, power interruptions could be out of faulty electrical wiring or any disturbances in the power lines, from the generators to the complex system of transformers and outlets.
