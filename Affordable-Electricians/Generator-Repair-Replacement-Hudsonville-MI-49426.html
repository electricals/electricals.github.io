<p>The difference between a lighting installation and a thermostat or phone is the power consumption and possibility of overheating. It's usually a small unit and has only one voltage available, so you will have some effect from "voltage drop" - a kind of line loss that occurs from fixture to fixture or over any amount of wire distance. Here are some tips that will go a long way in helping you avoid some common problems with backup generators. The leading other known types of equipment involved in home electrical failure fires are range, washer, dryer and fans.</p>
