Hi, I am curious if while running garage electrical wiring, you can, or can not, run the wire from the electrical Outlet, DOWN the stud, across, then Back Up to the next Outlet. WARNING: If you connect a portable electric generator to the main electrical supply coming into the house, the electrical generator could feed back into your electric cooperative's system and electrocute workers who are repairing the electrical lines. The only safe way to extinguish an electrical fire is with a fire-retardant chemical fire extinguisher.</p>

A digital timer may be used for more complex lighting systems where multiple start times are required including start times on different days of the week.</p>
<p>Many protectors will connect to all three in pairs (line-neutral, line-ground and neutral-ground), because there are conditions, such as lightning, where both line and neutral have high voltage spikes that need to be shorted to ground. The inexpensive, portable generators are almost a no-brainer to have around for the occasional outage. Some states also have multiple levels of master electrician licensing.
