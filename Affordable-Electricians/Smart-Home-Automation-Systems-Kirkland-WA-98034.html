No other landscaping company in the Hollywood, Santa Monica, and Malibu area will offer you a 5-year warranty on a lighting installation. You should have the white from the panel and a jumper from the black to the panel connected to the outlet, on opposite sides.

It's imperative that the size of the wires you choose matches the amperage of the circuit.</p>

When a surge protective device senses a transient voltage spike, it uses internal components called Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs) that act like magnets for the excess voltage, and sends it to the load center's ground wire before it can reach your home's connected electronics.</p>
