If the outlets ARE half hot, with one half of it switched, it will not be possible to reproduce that with the new outlets.</p>

That's why a lot of employers recommend getting some basic electrical training before applying for the apprenticeships that they sponsor. In your switch box you should have one or more grounding conductors spliced together with a wire connector or wire crimp.</p>
