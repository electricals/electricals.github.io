The tasks involve troubleshooting for electrical faults, replacing faulty wires or other components such as light switches, electrical outlets and breaker boxes. Electrical Contractor License: This license is considered as equivalent to a master electrician license.

Experts say that in addition to the generator itself, consumers should also buy a transfer switch, which connects the generator to the circuit box of your home, and fuel for the generator.

Once you are settled in your home and spending some quiet time out on your back deck or patio take some time in the evening to imagine what your back yard or garden area would look night after nightfall if you had some strategically placed lighting incorporated into your landscape and other areas and do not forget to think about adding some additional or different deck lights and lighting surrounding the areas close to the house.</p>
