Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>
<p>Bus Bars:Also known as the hot bus bars, are metallic strips that conduct electrical current and serve as one of the main connection centers for the circuits. If the lights in your house sometimes flicker or the breaker shuts off when you're using multiple appliances, your breaker might be at full capacity, and it might be time to upgrade.

<p>These indoor units are manufactured with secondary input connections that are compatible with wiring methods from NEC chapter 3, such as those that include ½ inch knockouts or NM cable clamp, permitting compliance with 411.4. Section 411.4 states that low-voltage lighting systems must not be concealed or the wiring must not extend through a building wall, unless using a wiring method specified in chapter 3. The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
<p>Halogen lights might appeal to you initially since their starting price points are lower than LED fixtures.
