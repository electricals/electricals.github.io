And all modern Wi-Fi enabled, digital dimmers and USB charging outlets are tight fits in older single gang boxes.

Most state electrical codes require 100-amp electrical service but older homes were built when energy requirements were far less and 60 amps were sufficient.</p>
<p>Another benefit of LED lights is that they typically produce far less heat than other forms of lighting. A property's lighting can also be integrated with an existing security system for additional functionality. Let your landscape lighting illuminate every occasion and invite people into your home safely and beautifully - highlighting walkways, architectural elements, gathering spaces, water features and more.

It starts at about $3,000 for the 6- to 8-kw models and reaches from $5,000 to $10,000 for the 11- to 20-kw units. The variety of light fixtures and lighting accessories has grown exponentially.</p>
