<h3>Importance of Using a Olivehurst CA Licensed Electrician</h3>
<p>Cords are not jump ropes, clothes lines or leashes, and should never be used for anything other than their intended purpose. Care must be taken to check all parts of a de-energized circuit because control circuits frequently have cross-connected interlocks that bring power into the controller from another source.
