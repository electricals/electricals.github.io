Lighting can add a magical touch to an otherwise boring backyard. Let's say a homeowner is using a small space heater to buffer against the cold in an area of the home and this additional electrical load results in an over current condition on that circuit, a reliable circuit breaker recognizes what is happening and turns the power off by "tripping", this allows the homeowner an opportunity to investigate what has happened before any damage is done.</p>
