<p>Many new panels grant homeowners the ability to add additional circuits as needed. An electrical panel is the point at which power reaches a property from the utility provider.

<p>Basically, electrical wires are color coded to prevent wiring errors. Low voltage lighting is less permanent than standard line voltage lighting, which is quite difficult to re-arrange. More specifically, when electrical systems are damaged in a natural or man-made disaster, electricians need to make critical decisions about whether the electrical equipment that was damaged can be salvaged or not. Otherwise, frequent wiring issues, burnt bulbs, and other electrical problems that arise from faulty installations may burn a hole in your pocket.</p>
