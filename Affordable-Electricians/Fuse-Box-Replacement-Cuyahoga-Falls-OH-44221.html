Electricians are skilled at reading blueprints and technical diagrams, figuring out the best methods for installing new wiring, replacing old systems, identifying problems through the use of the proper devices, and following all state and local building and safety codes.</p>

<p>By now you should have sketched a layout of your lighting system which will determine the length of wire, style of lights being used (low voltage variety) and their locations. An electrical upgrade will also help avoid electrical hazards. Stay away from electrical equipment, such as substations, transformer boxes and electric poles.
