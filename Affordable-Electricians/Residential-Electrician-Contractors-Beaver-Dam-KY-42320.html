<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Contractor in Beaver Dam</h2>
<p>With a well designed landscape, homeowners want to spend as much time as possible outside. Well in a parallel circuit, each light has its own circuit (or its on hot and neutral wire) and the voltage across each of the components is the same; the current increases, but the voltage stays the same. If your outlets are warm, or extension cords get hot, they are probably overloaded. A new service panel can enhance safety and property value.

<p>The 100 amp electrical service in your home is insufficient for operating necessary appliances. Part of the current from the black wire will return through the white wire on the red wire GFCI, causing an imbalance in both GFCI's. This connects to the generator so you can plug in appliances without running (potentially risky) extension cords outdoors. The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it.
