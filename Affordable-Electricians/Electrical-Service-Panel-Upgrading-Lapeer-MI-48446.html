You can expect the whole house generator to start working within five minutes of power outage. Unlike portable generators, permanent standby generators can spring into action very quickly. You might carefully remove and re-route the existing wire lower in the wall or you might buy all new electrical wire - depending on the age and condition of the existing materials. Over time, the connections between electrical wires and switches or outlets can loosen Check to make sure that all outlet covers and switch plates are in good condition and that the wires inside are secure.</p>
<p>To access the wiring, gently pull the switches out of the electrical boxes. People often think of power strips when they hear "surge protection". Check electric cords often for damage. One of the deterrents to more market adoption, especially for standby generators, may be price: John Hoch, the president of Power Equipment Direct, which sells home generators, says that a home standby generator will cost between about $2,000 and $5,000 or more (depending on power and size), not including installation.</p>
<p>Honeywell Home Standby Generators automatically detect a power outage and deliver backup power to your home within seconds. While tests differ, you will need to understand electrical theory, the National Electrical Code®, local electrical codes, and the various types of wiring methods and materials. The job of an electrician is physically demanding and can be very dangerous if it's not done correctly. Fire safety officials throughout the U.S. endorse AFCIs as a significant step forward in electrical fire safety.</p>
