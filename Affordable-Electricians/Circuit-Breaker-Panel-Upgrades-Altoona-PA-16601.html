<p>Doing electrical wiring by yourself can be tricky. A systems capacity is determined by size of transformer, wattage of fixtures, and the gauge of wire which helps to determine voltage drop over distance. No, one wire size too small won't hurt with a short pigtail, though if it goes from the switch to the outlet it should definitely be the right size. It is important to make sure that your electrician is licensed, not only to ensure that there is quality work being done to your wires, but also for a host of other reasons.</p>
<p>For safe wire connections, cut all the wires to leave at least 6 in. protruding past the face of the box. The first and most likely is that the contacts involved are not properly closing and are making a poor connection, which prevents them passing current to the coil as they should.
