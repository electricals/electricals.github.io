When service to your home or business is upgraded or changed, that capacity is increasedâ€”standard electrical panels can provide 100, 150, 200, 325, 400, 600 or 800 amps of power, allowing the potential for more circuits to be added.

<p>So, if you have a 3-ton (36,000BTU) air conditioner, for example, it will require a standby generator that is 11kW or larger. Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device.

Both of these numbers must be calculated: running watts represent the power consumed by an electrical motor while running normally, and starting KVA is required because each time an electrical motor starts up, there's an extra electrical surge that the generator must be able to handle. A panel upgrade involves changing the electric panel equipment serving your home or business.</p>
