Advances in Electrical Safety Codes throughout the years. Newer outlets have a third opening where the third prong of a plug can go in. As with the light switch, there is a grounding terminal located on the end of the outlet which connects the third prong of the plug to the grounding circuit. NEC 411.2 provides the definition for low-voltage lighting systems and states that one or more power supply secondary low-voltage circuits are permissible but each circuit is limited to 25 amperes maximum with a maximum voltage of 30 volts, ac or dc.</p>
<p>The Standard for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting Systems, UL 1838, covers the safety requirements for landscape lighting systems; the Standard for Low Voltage Lighting Systems, UL 2108, covers incandescent luminaires and luminaire fittings; and the Standard for Low Voltage Lighting Systems for Use in Recreational Vehicles, UL 234, covers luminaires for recreational vehicles.

<p>Solar outdoor lights are probably the most popular type of outdoor lighting available on the market. If necessary, cut the sod around the light fixtures with the shovel. For example, select a transformer rated for 400 or 500 watts if you have landscape lights equaling 300 watts, such as six 50-watt pathway lights. Surge protection has been required by the National Electrical Code (NEC) since 2014, and 82% of surveyed professionals indicated that surge protection is necessary to protect expensive equipment.</p>

<p>Caution needs taken if it is to be done from the switch box, however, as there will be a lot of wires in that box and a deep or oversize box will be required. Always err on the side of caution and seek the help of a licensed electrician. Before you go out and buy a bunch of landscape lighting fixtures, there are a few things that you need to do.
