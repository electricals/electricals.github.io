This poses danger to your bathroom electrical wiring, so it is best to install an exhaust fan so that air can circulate inside the bathroom space and no steam or moisture will build up inside. 2. LED lighting greatly reduces maintenance costs.

The system will automatically shed‚Äù electrical items that are less important, then put them back online when more power is available.
