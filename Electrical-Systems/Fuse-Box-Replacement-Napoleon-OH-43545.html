Use wiring that is made for outdoor use and always install weatherproof receptacles and boxes. Unlike electricians who work with many types of lighting and electrical jobs, custom outdoor landscape lighting is all we do, and we believe in doing it right the first time.</p>
<p>Keep all appliance cords away from hot surfaces (toasters, range tops, ovens, etc.). Cords can be damaged by excessive heat. These 12V led lights will not get over heated or burn up like other incandescent or halogen bulb fixtures and will remain pretty cool outside ever after long hours of running since they produce a minimum amount of heat to the surroundings as well.

Experience: Typical experience for an industrial electrician is the installation of process equipment that requires specific knowledge of the manufacturing industry we are in. Wiring in a food processing plant uses different procedures than wiring in a automotive production facility.

<p>And since they're low voltage (you can literally add wires and lights to the system while it's operating), they're safe to use and install.

<p>Walk through the house and make a list of everything you want to power during an outage. Both of these numbers must be calculated: running watts represent the power consumed by an electrical motor while running normally, and starting KVA is required because each time an electrical motor starts up, there's an extra electrical surge that the generator must be able to handle.
