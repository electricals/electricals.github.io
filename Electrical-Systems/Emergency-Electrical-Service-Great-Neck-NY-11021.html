<p>The usual mode for a standby generator is 'idle' however it must be able to immediately start up if the mains power fails. The electricity that comes to our homes from power plants travels at incredibly high voltages because that helps to save energy.

In many homes, if a room does not have an overhead light, most builders will install a switch that controls half of the outlets in the room.
