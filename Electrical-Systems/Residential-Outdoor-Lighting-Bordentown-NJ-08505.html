<p>So, if you have a 3-ton (36,000BTU) air conditioner, for example, it will require a standby generator that is 11kW or larger. Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device. Portable generators usually offer between 2 and 8 kilowatts; 4 to 6 kW is usually enough to power a home's essential appliances, like lights and a portable heater, says Yago.

Always be on the lookout for faulty electrical objects in your home or business - electrical safety should be a top priority. Residential electricians wire houses under construction, and upgrade older houses. So, you need to have a certified, licensed electrician inspect your breaker box.</p>
<p>Installation of these devices is typically performed by a licensed electrician or contractor. For any electrical installation that requires a uniform building permit under SPS 320.08 , a person who holds an electrical contractor license may not commence installation of electrical wiring until a permit is issued for the installation. Tip: Both NM and AC cable require special cutting tools that cut the sheathing but not the wires; bushings inserted in the ends to prevent the sharp edges of the metal from damaging the wires; and special electrical boxes and connectors.</p>

In receptacle boxes with more than one cable in the box, the ground wires must be spliced with a wire tail to be attached to the ground screw on the receptacle or switch, as only one conductor is permitted under a terminal screw. Generac generators make for a good, cheaper alternative to some of the more expensive brands.
