<p>While electronics are becoming almost indispensable to our daily lives they are vulnerable to power surges. Our technician will work with you to transform your home lighting arrangement to give your home an updated, modern look with LED lights. Not all rubber insulated copper wire is plated, but if you suspect that the silvery-colored wire is plated copper, it's easy enough to determine: with the wire disconnected from any power source, scratch the silver colored surface of the rubber-insulated wire and you'll see its red copper interior. If you go a long period without needing your portable backup generator, you may spend a lot of money on gasoline you cannot use.</p>

Generally speaking, lighter colored wall plates look best with white, almond or ivory; darker plate finishes look best with black or brown; and silvery metal finishes look best with nickel, gray or clear.

<p>Task lighting is used to focus on areas you will be working in. Enclosed fixtures are typically found in halls, bedrooms & bathrooms. The licenses are awarded by the Board of State Examiners of Electricians. Extension cords are generally rated in amps and volts. Depending on your situation, the power outage can last for several days and not having electricity for so long can be dangerous - especially if you run into an emergency.
