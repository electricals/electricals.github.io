<p>However a number of traditions associated with domestic electrical wiring in the UK still differ significantly from other countries including ring circuits, fused plugs, switch sockets, absence of normal switches and sockets in bathrooms, historic wiring colours and asymmetric supply-voltage tolerances.

Outdoor solar lights are a little more expensive to purchase but they are much easier to install. Electrical outlets without any protective covering over the holes of the socket pose a significant risk, particularly to young children. Instead of snaking a long cable around to reach all of your lights, use a few shorter lines that each include just a few lights and less total distance.</p>
