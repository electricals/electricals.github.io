Due to the fact that it involves working so closely with electrical wires, any work involving your circuit breaker panel requires the assistance of qualified and experienced electricians. Not manufactured since the mid-1970s, these panels have design flaws that allow power to flow even when the breakers appear off.</p>

Today, given the growing number of computers, high def televisions, multiple appliances and electrical devices that many homes have, having at least 200 amp electrical panel is needed to support this high level of usage. Half-hot outlets are most frequently found in living rooms, but can be put into any location. The National Electric Code requires that all lighting switch boxes contain a "neutral", which is an electrical term for a grounded conductor (not to be confused with a ground wire).</p>
<p>Nearly all household wire is copper, though aluminum is occasionally used. A surge protector or surge suppressor is an appliance or device designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead). If you've noticed that the electrical outlets in your home aren't working as well as they use to, or they aren't able to hold the plug, it may be time to repair or replace it. Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you do not have the wire necessary in the box to make a half hot - the permanent hot is missing and only the switched hot is available.
