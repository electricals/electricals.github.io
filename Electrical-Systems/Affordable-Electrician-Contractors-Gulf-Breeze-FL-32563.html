<p>5. Electric dryers require a 30-amp outlet protected by a 30-amp circuit breaker, while an electric oven mandates a 50-amp and 8-gauge wire protected by a 50-amp breaker.

You simply have to purchase the right length of wire and the adequate number of bulbs and you can start your installation.</p>
