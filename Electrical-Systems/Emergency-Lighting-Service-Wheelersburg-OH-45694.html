Having whole house surge protection is important if you want to prevent electric damage that can occur and damage your computer, the other electronics that are connected and the safety of your home.

<p>My best advice is to have all the wiring evaluated by a licensed electrician for safety, preferable one that is familiar with aluminum and if you can keep from changing out receptacles, switches and lighting that would be best, just don't mess with it. I know if you are doing a complete rehab, you will want to change out lights, old and dirty light switches and receptacles with many coats of paint, but if you can clean them up, you are better off.</p>
<p>According to the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNACHI), you should make regular checks to your electric panel, even if you haven't needed to undertake any electrical fixes. Inspect all your home's light switches and outlets. These are some of the most prominently featured specifications which define a surge protector for AC mains, as well as for some data communications protection applications.

When you add up the wattage of all lights, you'll have a good idea of how powerful your transformer needs to be. However, the total wattage of your lights should be 20 percent less than the transformer's rated wattage.</p>

After triggering, the low clamping voltage allows large current surges while limiting heat dissipation in the device. LEDs for outdoor lighting are becoming more available- but be aware that there are significant quality and color temperature differences. Lighting transformers come in a variety of sizes and you will need one big enough to handle the number and wattage of the light bulbs it will be powering.</p>
