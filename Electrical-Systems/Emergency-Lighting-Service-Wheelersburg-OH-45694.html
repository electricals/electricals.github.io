I know if you are doing a complete rehab, you will want to change out lights, old and dirty light switches and receptacles with many coats of paint, but if you can clean them up, you are better off.</p>
<p>According to the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNACHI), you should make regular checks to your electric panel, even if you haven't needed to undertake any electrical fixes. Inspect all your home's light switches and outlets.

LEDs for outdoor lighting are becoming more available- but be aware that there are significant quality and color temperature differences. Lighting transformers come in a variety of sizes and you will need one big enough to handle the number and wattage of the light bulbs it will be powering.</p>
