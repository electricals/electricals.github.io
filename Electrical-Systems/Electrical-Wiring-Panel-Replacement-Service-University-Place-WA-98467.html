The electricity that comes to our homes from power plants travels at incredibly high voltages because that helps to save energy. Create a point of interest by highlighting a particular tree, shrub, or architectural aspect of you landscape with a flood light placed at ground level and focused upward. Today, almost all electronic devices have components placed on printed circuit boards. It is strongly recommended that you connect all cables and power cords to the unit for providing full maximum protection.</p>
<p>This is something that needs to be approved by the power company (A.P.S. or S.R.P.).

Experts say that in addition to the generator itself, consumers should also buy a transfer switch, which connects the generator to the circuit box of your home, and fuel for the generator. Motion activated lights adds security to your home, lighting up your home and warding off those that choose move in the dark.</p>
<p>Home centers carry a limited selection of portable generators (but usually no standby units). Stick with one voltage - 120 volts AC. Also, don't touch electrical equipment, including light switches and power cords, with wet or damp hands. This will be the biggest switch on the electrical panel, and will often be in the form of two switches fused together.

<p>We created this electrical safety checklist for your safety and peace of mind, but it's no substitute for an annual electrical inspection by an electrician.
