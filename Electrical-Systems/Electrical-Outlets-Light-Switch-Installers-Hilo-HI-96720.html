This could involve isolating components and evaluating their circuit parameters or isolating the circuits by group when dealing with a complicated circuit.</p>
<p>At the outlet box, neither the existing black or white wires will be used for the outlet, but may be powering other outlets on the circuit if this is not a new outlet.
