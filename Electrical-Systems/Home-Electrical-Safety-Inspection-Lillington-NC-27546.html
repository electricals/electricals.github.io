Like an AC or furnace, your electrical panel (also called a breaker box) needs to be the right size to handle the electrical load for your home.

With today's reliance on electrical appliances, many homes are not capable of handling the amount of power needed solve that problem by letting Canaan Tech Mechanical upgrade your main electrical panel.
