<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Danville</h2>
<p>Doing electrical wiring by yourself can be tricky. A systems capacity is determined by size of transformer, wattage of fixtures, and the gauge of wire which helps to determine voltage drop over distance. No, one wire size too small won't hurt with a short pigtail, though if it goes from the switch to the outlet it should definitely be the right size. It is important to make sure that your electrician is licensed, not only to ensure that there is quality work being done to your wires, but also for a host of other reasons.</p>
<p>Turn the breaker on to test the outlet and, if it works, turn the breaker off and secure the outlet back into the wall. No, not having a ground on the switch won't make the outlet fail to work.
