When you open an outlet, it can be useful to figure out the position of the outlet or switch in the circuit, as well as the function of each wire.</p>

If any wires are doubled up on one side of the light switch, meaning more than one wire under one screw or stab-hole, twist those two wires together and tail off with a single lead wire just like the receptacles. The inspection will help identify problems like frequently blowing fuses or tripping circuit breakers, loose connections at outlets, older and deteriorated wiring, and outdated and overburdened electrical service.</p>
<p>You cannot connect a receptacle outlet to this switch wiring, but you can at the ceiling electrical box, assuming there is enough room for the extra wires.
