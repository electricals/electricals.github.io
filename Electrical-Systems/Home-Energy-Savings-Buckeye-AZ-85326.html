<p>Portable generators should never be run indoors as they can produce fumes that can cause serious health problems or death if used indoors. The circuit will never open now even if you remove the plug from the wires. In the 1960s up to the mid-1970s, aluminum wiring became a fairly popular option as copper prices were very expensive.

<p>Thank you so much for helping, I found where the main power comes from and it's hooked to the GFI that's next to the switch, so I did a pigtail of the (hot) black wire to the switch and then the other black wire that runs from the outlet from underneath the sink to the other bronze screw on the switch. Depending on application, proper installation requires meeting noise, fuel storage, building and electrical codes, and emission ordinances. Upon sensing the return to the utility power source, the generator automatically shuts down and returns to standby mode.</p>
