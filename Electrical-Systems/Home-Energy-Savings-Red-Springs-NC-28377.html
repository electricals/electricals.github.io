This lower light switch height will allow you to avoid interfering with higher-up obstructions on the wall like backsplashes or cabinetry, while still hovering four inches above the top of a standard 36-inch-tall counter.</p>
<p>Cables are color coded to tell you about the size of the wires inside the cable. Might be switched, but not only half of it. A power check will also tell you if power is making it to the switch.
