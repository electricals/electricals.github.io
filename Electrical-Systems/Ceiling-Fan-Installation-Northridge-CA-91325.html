All electrical items used in and around water (i.e. in the kitchen, bathroom, or wet areas in the basement) should be locked away from children. Portable generators powered by natural gas or propane is the best choice if available. Make sure cords attached to an aquarium have a drip loop—cords that slack below the outlet—to make sure water does not run into the outlet.</p>
