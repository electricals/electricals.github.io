Consult an electrician to learn whether your home's panel is still capable of providing the electricity you need or whether it's time to consider an upgrade. As a general rule houses are not supplied with enough power sockets or switches for additional lighting. Landscape fixtures are also available in LED, which will use far less power than traditional halogen or incandescent lighting. Electrical panels have evolved over time, and many designs that were common in the mid-20th century no longer meet contemporary electrical needs.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, some Canadian provinces only grant "permit pulling privileges" to current Master Electricians, that is, a journeyman who has been engaged in the industry for three (3) years AND has passed the Master's examination (i.e. Alberta).

The inexpensive, portable generators are almost a no-brainer to have around for the occasional outage. Some states also have multiple levels of master electrician licensing.
