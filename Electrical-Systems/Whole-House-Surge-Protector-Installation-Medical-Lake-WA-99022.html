As a general rule houses are not supplied with enough power sockets or switches for additional lighting. Landscape fixtures are also available in LED, which will use far less power than traditional halogen or incandescent lighting.

<p>To access the wiring, gently pull the switches out of the electrical boxes. People often think of power strips when they hear "surge protection". Check electric cords often for damage. One of the deterrents to more market adoption, especially for standby generators, may be price: John Hoch, the president of Power Equipment Direct, which sells home generators, says that a home standby generator will cost between about $2,000 and $5,000 or more (depending on power and size), not including installation.</p>

It's also worth considering the placement of light switches if family members are getting older or have lost mobility and would have trouble reaching a switch while seated in a wheelchair. A digital timer may be used for more complex lighting systems where multiple start times are required including start times on different days of the week.</p>
