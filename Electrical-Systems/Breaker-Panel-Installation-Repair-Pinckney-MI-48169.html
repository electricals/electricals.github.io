<p>There are many factors and considerations with residential wind generators which might make this energy solution the right option for you. Repairs could be minor and nominal in cost, such as the cleaning and tightening of connections or the addition of outlets, or more involved running into several thousand dollars, such as the addition of circuits and sub-panels, replacement of degraded wiring, or, particularly with older homes, a heavy-up” — that is, upgrading the electrical service from, for example, 60 amp or 100 amp service to the home to 200 amp service better able to handle today's electric demands.</p>

It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back.
