Some models come with a recoil starter, just like a lawn mower's starter, other come with an electric (battery) push-button starter, and other comes with an auto start switch, also called a transfer switch, that must be wired directly to your home's existing electrical system. It is possible that there will come a day when all of the lights are out because you failed to deal with the issue.</p>
