<p>EC&M ranks the biggest electrical contracting companies of the year. As a homeowner, it's wise to know where the breaker panel in your house is located in the case of an emergency or the sudden need to cut off or restore power.

You can purchase low voltage landscape lighting kits from the home improvement store, and these kits will probably include the transformer necessary to match the fixtures.

With the generator running, the switch closed, and the voltmeter probes attached to the current conductor and neutral conductor connections of the motor, the voltmeter will indicate the voltage potential at the motor. Remove the old light from its socket and remove the twist-on wire connectors securing the electrical conductors to the fixture.</p>
