<p>There are many reasons that we need a backup power generator at home. Consult an electrician to learn whether your home's panel is still capable of providing the electricity you need or whether it's time to consider an upgrade. As a general rule houses are not supplied with enough power sockets or switches for additional lighting. Landscape fixtures are also available in LED, which will use far less power than traditional halogen or incandescent lighting.

<p>The Standard for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting Systems, UL 1838, covers the safety requirements for landscape lighting systems; the Standard for Low Voltage Lighting Systems, UL 2108, covers incandescent luminaires and luminaire fittings; and the Standard for Low Voltage Lighting Systems for Use in Recreational Vehicles, UL 234, covers luminaires for recreational vehicles.
