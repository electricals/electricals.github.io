If you have a home that's older than 30 years and all of the electrical is original to the house, this is an aspect of home maintenance that you should be aware of. Circuit breakers that are old might not have enough capacity to keep up with today's needs, or you might even have a fuse box, which is an outdated system.</p>

Power generators have come a long way in terms of safety.

<p>That do not have a grounding prong to protect against falling objects bridging hot and neutral. Optical isolation uses an LED (Light Emitting Device) and a photosensitive transistor to transfer data across the isolation barrier - typically an air gap; in other words, data is transmitted using light instead of electrical signals, so there is no physical connections between the grounds and the data lines, thus removing the ground loop problems and effectively preventing electrical surges and spikes from destroying other parts of the system.</p>

These spotlights are specially designed for use with trees. It is in this line of thought the surge protectors were invented.
