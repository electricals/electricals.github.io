<p>Why Your Home Could Need an Electrical Panel Upgrade. Running extension cords through the house can trip up residents; this can cause injury and damage to the wire or outlet if it causes the cord to be ripped out of the wall. In Box 1, disconnect a wire on the old switch and attach it to the correct terminal on the new one. Always consult with a licensed electrician before installing new pool lights or repairing existing ones. We will help you pick the right whole-home generator system, we will size your generator, and then our local electricians can install and integrate the system so that you never need to worry about a storm again.</p>
