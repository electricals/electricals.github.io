<p>Blue Streak technicians are trained to work on all types of lighting fixtures. Outdoor low voltage lighting serves both aesthetic and practical purposes and can provide safety and beauty to your home - and it doesn't have to cost a fortune to install. Without a breaker panel, none of your electronic devices or appliances will work. The first thing that you're going to want to do and this is the most important, is to make sure that the electricity they shut off, to the light fixture that you are about to be working on. Most of the time, this would simply require making sure that the light switch that operates the ceiling fixture, is turned to the off position.</p>

Licenses Issued Through: No state licensing of contractors or electricians; many local jurisdictions require licensing of contractors and one or more electricians working on a job site. Decorative exterior lights add another level of sophistication to a home and landscape. Also be on the lookout for the value in joules, this is a reflection of the amount of voltage that can be safely absorbed by the protector, before it fails, obviously the higher the number then the greater the degree of protection that is on offer.</p>
