When power comes on again you can turn the switch off and disconnect the generator and return your setup to normal.

<h3>Choosing an Ideal Surge Protection Device in Wharton TX</h3>

Ensure that power is off to the entire building, which may involve more than just shutting off the main breaker.</p>
<p>For example, devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners require large amounts of energy to switch motors and compressors on and off, creating surges in power that disrupt the steady flow of voltage. A good rule of thumb is to treat all wires as if they're live, so first connect the ground wire, then neutral wire, then load, and lastly hot.
