Since the systems use low voltage of only 12 volts, the systems are safe for the novice to install, and the components are lightweight, making them easy to handle.

Do not enter an electrical power substation, or other marked areas. With its 22000 watts, it is powerful enough to provide energy supply for the entire home including all major appliances requiring higher wattage such as air conditioning, heating, TVs etc. Many homes are outfitted with the wrong electrical panels, either because the panel they use is too small to support the electricity they use or the panel is outdated.</p>
<p>Make sure all 3-wired tools and appliances with flexible cords are properly grounded. There are some wiring systems out there that are actually better at conducting and are more efficient like fiber optics, but because of its wide availability copper wire still remains king. A good electrician has the required knowledge and experience to deal with electrical complications and therefore he is likely to be able to analyze the situation better and handle it accordingly.</p>
