<p>Standby generators wired into your business' electric system require proper installation to prevent generator failure or overheating, and damage to your existing wiring and equipment. Generator repair is just as important as initial installation. These minor surges might occur from things like fan motors or other large power drain devices turning on and off frequently. These numbers don't even factor in the more than $800 million in property loses annually linked to electrical fires and other related issues.</p>
<p>If you're pulling wire from a circuit that has 12-gauge wire, don't install 14-gauge wire to the new receptacle or vice versa. When wiring landscape lights, the best place to start is to layout your lighting plan on a piece of paper. It takes approximately 9 months to complete the Residential Electrician program.
