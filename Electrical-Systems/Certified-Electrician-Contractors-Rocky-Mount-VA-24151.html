All your electrical appliances and components share a common factor: the breaker panel.</p>

Severe weather is the single leading cause of power outages in the United States. In this case, you need to contact an electrician immediately, so they can either repair or upgrade it. Even if the electrician finds that your current panel can be repaired, we recommend replacing and upgrading it, if you can afford it. You will still need to eventually do this upgrade anyway.</p>
