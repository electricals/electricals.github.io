When you wire the new outlet only hook up the "hot" wire to the outlet, not the switched wire. Older wire could be aluminum or copper-clad aluminum.</p>
<p>Permanently installed generators run on either natural gas or propane. The size of the generator you need is directly related to the appliances you want to keep power running to. If you just needed a fridge to have power, the size of the generator would be much smaller.
