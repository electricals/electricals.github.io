<p>Many people are growing more and more energy conscious and there are many reasons for this. Have not less than 12,000 hours of experience obtained over a period of not less than 6 years related to electrical construction, the maintenance of buildings, or electrical wiring or equipment under the supervision of a master electrician or equivalent experience as determined by the Electrical Administrative Board.
