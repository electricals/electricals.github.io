In either case, having the wrong electrical panel for your residential or commercial property can cause electrical malfunctions or it may prevent your system from working at all. You can substitute 2,000 hours of education for experience.

With the proper preventative maintenance, you can keep your electrical system working like a well-oiled machine at all times, and our team of professionals can help you.</p>
<p>Job sites can be far from electricians' homes.

Shielded cables are wires that are covered in a metallic foil with individual wires, encased in a light metal case.

Our electricians take the time to discuss your needs, so you'll get the most reliable backup generator for your home.</p>

Progressive Service Company is the trusted name you can call when something goes wrong with your home's electricity.

After installation of the unit, our crew will simulate a power outage at your home and make sure the generator is running smoothly.</p>
