Mike, if your comment is a question of how to put in more than one outlet along a 12 foot wall, yes it's perfectly permitted to exceed the minimum number of receptacles along a wall. Add another wire to the black wires. For another $1,000, an automatic transfer switch could do all that work for them.</p>

The generator normally works by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy that is why you have the chance to continue home activities as the power outage goes on.</p>
<p>However, the extra black and white wires are for continuing the circuit to other areas of the house, so the outlet is also acting as a junction of sorts. The service panel is the point that connects your electrical system to the wiring that comes from outside the property. A surge protects the appliances from the TV to the small lines such as that of telephones. Because LV lighting is LV, it is very susceptible to voltage drop problems. This may well be already done in the box, though; otherwise you would have had TWO blacks and TWO reds to each outlet so that there was a black and red, both still hot, to supply the next outlet in line.</p>
