You might carefully remove and re-route the existing wire lower in the wall or you might buy all new electrical wire - depending on the age and condition of the existing materials. Over time, the connections between electrical wires and switches or outlets can loosen Check to make sure that all outlet covers and switch plates are in good condition and that the wires inside are secure.</p>
<p>When compared to less efficient lighting, LEDs have very low energy consumption. The BX wires are extremely durable and can last a really long time.
