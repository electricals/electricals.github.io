Intermittent humming or crackling noises coming from the electrical panel are reasons to call an electrician immediately.</p>
<p>Changing an electrical service panel isn't like changing a fuse or wiring a new ceiling fan. An electrical surge is an unexpected and uncontrolled spike in voltage on an electrical circuit.
