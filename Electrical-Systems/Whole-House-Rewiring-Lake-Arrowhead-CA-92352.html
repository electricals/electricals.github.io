<p>If the motor overloads control circuit is good (all NC contacts have continuity), then the field control circuit to the motor starter is the problem. Having a breaker trip saves you from potential electrical fires. Generators have two components, an engine that burns fuel such as, gas or propane and a generator that turns the power into electricity. The most obvious and important is to shut off the power at the breaker because an electric shock can kill you. For business owners, it is essential to hire an electrician with experience working in commercial buildings.</p>
<p>Standby generators also run a weekly test to check that they will respond well to an outage. Most of the time, they occur insidiously, when faulty electrical wiring heats up and begins to smolder gradually. Step 1.
