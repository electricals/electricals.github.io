After removing the old dimmer switch, I connected the new light switch to the 2 hot and ground wires using the included wire nuts.</p>
<p>In-field installation costs can be higher, since SM devices are installed in series with the power feed, requiring the feed to be cut and reconnected. To save on electricity costs, attach a photocell to your transformer so the lights automatically come on at sunset and go off at sunrise. Connecting lighting fixtures to line voltage is similar to connecting a garden hose nozzle directly to the spout - not to the end of the hose.

Tip: If the junction box is recessed a bit below the surface of the wall, you can put plastic spacers which look like thick washers on the mounting screws between the outlet or switch and the box.</p>
<p>Return of investment of these systems really depends on how much you spend a month on your power and depending on how much you paid for your solar power generator it can takes a couple of years to make your money back. Experts say that in addition to the generator itself, consumers should also buy a transfer switch, which connects the generator to the circuit box of your home, and fuel for the generator. Motion activated lights adds security to your home, lighting up your home and warding off those that choose move in the dark.</p>

Most places require documentation of 6,000 to 8,000 hours of apprenticeship, so find out what type of proof your state accepts for those hours. There are many different sizes, types, and brands of generators for both commercial and residential use on the market today.</p>
<p>Landscape lighting is one of the best security systems you can install. If there is only one cable in the box, you will have to get an additional wire up to the switch to get power to make half the outlet permanently hot. Even a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) with surge protection will not be able to handle a lighting strike that is close by.

The average height for light switches is 46 inches from the floor to the center of the switch box. This type of lighting requires no wiring and is the most energy-efficient lighting because it uses the sun's energy to recharge batteries. Yep, these are stones with LED lighting already built in. They are powered by a solar rechargeable Siemens silicone solar cell Ni-Cad battery that can hold a charge for up to 8 hours at a time.</p>
<p>Interest in low voltage, or 12v, lighting has grown in our increasingly energy-conscious customers over the last several years, with the emergence and proliferation of long-life, energy-efficient lighting. I sprung for a $100 700W generator a few years ago, maybe another hundred bucks worth of parts, quality gas cans, and a propane camp stove.

<p>Lighting Tip: You can run 12-gauge about 100 feet without voltage drop issues as long as the total wattage of the fixtures on the wire is 100 Watts or less. But when the power goes out and an electrical system fails because of a tripped breaker, faulty wire, or natural disaster, it seems as if everything stops. Because electricians must travel to different worksites, local or long distance commuting is often required. All power outlets should be earthed or grounded to prevent electric shocks.</p>
