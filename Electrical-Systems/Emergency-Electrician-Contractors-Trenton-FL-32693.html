<p>It's really hard to fork out the money to replace expensive electronic equipment that has been damaged beyond repair. This helps protect people from being shocked, and it prevents fires due to electrical faults. Bill Locklin the inventor of the original 12 volt garden lighting system in the mid 1950's knew better than anyone how potentially dangerous 12 volts can be and in some cases even more dangerous than 120 volt main power.
