Also, a master electrician license is required. Choosing a certified, insured and licensed electrician for your electrical work is essential to ensuring the successful resolution of your electrical issues, and the safety of your home or business.</p>
<p>That's exactly what Schneider Electric does with the ‘Connected Power' badge within the EcoXpert partner program: help electrical contractors tap into the clear benefits by training them in acquiring these skillsets and, at least as important, understand the existing connected power solutions such as smart panels, smart metering and the energy management and efficiency systems in the cloud , which make all the difference from the contractor, customer and optimization and services perspective.</p>
<p>Master Electrician (General) License: A minimum 6-years practical experience is required.

This is the amount of power your choice of the best whole house generator must provide in order to meet your needs.</p>
<p>When considering an upgrade to your home's electrical wiring, you must take into account the age of your home and the age of the current wiring that is installed. Lights in your home do little good if you can't turn them on, and the power going through your home is useless if your outlets aren't ready and capable to handle appliances. Flickering fluorescent lights, broken light switches, and old wiring are no match for lighting repair professionals.
