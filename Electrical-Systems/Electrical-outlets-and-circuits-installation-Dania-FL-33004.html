<p>We bought the Generac 20kW and even though we have not needed it, it is a big insurance policy for us if something would happen that we would lose our electricity.

Air-cooled generators are smaller and less costly, but they're also louder than liquid-cooled models, even though liquid-cooled generators are typically larger. This wiring is now required in most switch boxes as of 2011.
