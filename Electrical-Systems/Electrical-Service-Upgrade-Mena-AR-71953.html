Although it's an electrical application, low voltage lighting takes very little energy to run and is relatively safe. Keep electrical cords out of the way. If your property doesn't have an exterior ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet, essential for powering a low voltage lighting system, a licensed electrician will have to add one, which will add to the expense.
