This measures the property's use of electricity, in a unit of measurement called a kilowatt hour (kWh). If you're noticing minor rust on your breaker panel's housing, have it inspected by an electrician. Electrical problems are among the leading causes of home fires in the United States alone.</p>
<p>If you think you might add more lights in the future then choose a transformer with a max wattage that's 100 to 200 Watts higher than the current total wattage of your fixtures.
