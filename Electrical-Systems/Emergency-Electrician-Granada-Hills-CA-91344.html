<p>Stationary generators must be professionally installed by a contractor, usually on a permanent pad near your home. Other older homes had dangerous electrical conditions. If you live in an area with frequent, prolonged outages, rely on electrically powered medical equipment, or work at home and need to stay connected, a backup generator can protect you from a disruption you may not be able to afford. Transformers for your 12v lighting design typically come in sizes of 300, 600, 1000 and 1200 watts.</p>

This isn't too surprising, as being an electrician often means crouching, kneeling and bending to reach the electrical installations you're supposed to be working on.
