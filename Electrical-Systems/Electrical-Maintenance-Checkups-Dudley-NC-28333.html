<p>It seems like just about everyone reaches a point in their life when they want to be a landlord. From this spot - often referred to as the service drop or service wire - your service panel directs electricity to different parts of the home.

Our 24 Hour electrical repair team will arrive properly equipped, tooled and with after hour access to our local parts warehouse to minimize any additional delays or down time.</p>
<p>Remember that power strips only add outlets—they do not change the amount of power the outlet receives. You will, of course, need an already existing outlet that is half switched or will need to add a switch yourself. Neatly fold the wires into the box in this order: grounds, neutrals and then hots.

But when the power goes out and an electrical system fails because of a tripped breaker, faulty wire, or natural disaster, it seems as if everything stops.
