Again, the ground wire always gets connected to the green screw, no matter the wiring scenario. In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle.

<p>Overheating electrical service conductors. Starting with the whole circuit as the problem area, take each noted observation and ask yourself "what does this tell me about the circuit operation?"
