Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
<p>Nearly all household wire is copper, though aluminum is occasionally used. A surge protector or surge suppressor is an appliance or device designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead).
