As with the light switch, there is a grounding terminal located on the end of the outlet which connects the third prong of the plug to the grounding circuit. NEC 411.2 provides the definition for low-voltage lighting systems and states that one or more power supply secondary low-voltage circuits are permissible but each circuit is limited to 25 amperes maximum with a maximum voltage of 30 volts, ac or dc.</p>

Today, given the growing number of computers, high def televisions, multiple appliances and electrical devices that many homes have, having at least 200 amp electrical panel is needed to support this high level of usage. Half-hot outlets are most frequently found in living rooms, but can be put into any location.
