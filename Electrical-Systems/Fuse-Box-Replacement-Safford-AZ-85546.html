<p>Unlike high voltage, Class 1 wiring, Class 2 wiring need not be installed by a licensed electrician. Residential electricians install wiring and troubleshoot electrical problems in peoples' homes, which can be either single-family or multi-family dwellings. Although lighting brings your garden and exterior amenities to life at night time, facade or feature lighting to the exterior of your home should also be considered. All your electrical appliances and components share a common factor: the breaker panel.</p>
<p>Installation electricians, or construction electricians, specialize in installing the electrical systems for newly constructed buildings. Factory, Industrial & Warehouse Lighting: The most dramatic and energy efficient results are seen when STG Electric Services replaces or retrofit older High Bay fixtures with new LED lighting technology. The downside is you have to run extension cords everywhere you want power and you're limited to how many things you can plug in at once (most generators have either two or four outlets).</p>
<p>Whether you need breaker panel installation or repair, you'll always enjoy honest recommendations and a personalized solution when you hire our trusted team of experts. If you are on a budget ask first how much does it cost for landscape lighting so you can prepare ahead of time. Above are some of the reasons to why you should consider electrical panel upgrade. This is convenient if you want to have a hot outlet to plug in a clock or other device that needs constant power but still control a nearby lamp with the wall switch.</p>
<p>Licenses Issued Through: No state licensing; some municipalities (e.g., City of Chicago's Department of Buildings , City of Aurora ) license journeymen and electrical contractors; separate licensing is required for firms that install or maintain fire and burglar alarm systems. While the entire duplex outlet could be turned on via a wall switch, only one of the two plug-ins is usually switched; this leaves the other half permanently powered for other uses.</p>
