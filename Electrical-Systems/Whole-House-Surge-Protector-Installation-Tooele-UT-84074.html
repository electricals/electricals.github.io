Although the terms wire and cable are often used interchangeably, electrical wire is one electrical conductor and electrical cable, like your AC power cord, is a group of wires (or conductors), encased in sheathing.</p>
<p>For this reason, using a surge protector for delicate electronics is well worth the money. Touch-Plate® switches only have two wires. From simple Ceiling Fan installs to full Service Electrical upgrades, there is no electrical job too small and no electrical project too large for our certified and highly experienced staff to handle. In some cases, additional protective components are necessary to prevent damage to a protected load, caused by high-speed let-through voltage which occurs before the GDT begins to operate.</p>
