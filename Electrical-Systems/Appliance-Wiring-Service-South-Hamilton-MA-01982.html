WARNING: If you connect a portable electric generator to the main electrical supply coming into the house, the electrical generator could feed back into your electric cooperative's system and electrocute workers who are repairing the electrical lines. The only safe way to extinguish an electrical fire is with a fire-retardant chemical fire extinguisher.</p>
