<p>A registered electrician should always do new appliances in bathrooms and any new installation of cabling. Outdoor solar lights are a little more expensive to purchase but they are much easier to install. Electrical outlets without any protective covering over the holes of the socket pose a significant risk, particularly to young children.

Nowadays people are turning to energy efficient lighting technologies to accomplish this by using lower voltage landscape lighting.
