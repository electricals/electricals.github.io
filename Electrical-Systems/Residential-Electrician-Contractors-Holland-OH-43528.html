It is recommended that you turn off your home's main circuit breaker until you determine the source of the smoke while you wait on an electrician to arrive.

You must still remove the red (or whatever color is switched) wires and splice them together with a wire nut if there is more than one of them. Immediately addressing the problem with your electrical panel will help you avoid emergency situations and potential issues such as power surges, electrical shocks, and circuit overloads.</p>
