Transformers or power-packs are designed to plug into any 120vac house circuit and reduces the output voltage to 12vac which creates a low-voltage system. If your breaker box isn't functioning properly, it's very likely your home's appliances won't function properly either.</p>

Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
<p>Take a look at how the outlet is wired up. You'll notice that there are two black wires connected to the outlet on one side and two white wires on the other side, as well as a bare copper wire connected to a green screw.

LEDs for outdoor lighting are becoming more available- but be aware that there are significant quality and color temperature differences. Lighting transformers come in a variety of sizes and you will need one big enough to handle the number and wattage of the light bulbs it will be powering.</p>
