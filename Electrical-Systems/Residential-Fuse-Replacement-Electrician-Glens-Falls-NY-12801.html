The tasks involve troubleshooting for electrical faults, replacing faulty wires or other components such as light switches, electrical outlets and breaker boxes. Electrical Contractor License: This license is considered as equivalent to a master electrician license. Dim or flickering lights can be a sign of a serious electrical work issue, which is why you should call a professional as soon as possible. Portable generators keep vital appliances running during a blackout.</p>

There are many different types of electrical outlets, some of which are required for specific appliances. Transformers or power-packs are designed to plug into any 120vac house circuit and reduces the output voltage to 12vac which creates a low-voltage system.

And for those of you who are still utilizing those old fashioned hanging dining fixtures that dangle with the intent of being centered over your kitchen or dining room table, it is time for those to hit the trash.

Let our trusted Spokane residential electricians work with you to create the perfect lighting experience for your home or business.
