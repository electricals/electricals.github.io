<p>Rehabbing a home built between 1965 - 1973? Conversely this also means the protector will absorb less and less energy as the harmful power is diverted into the ground. Portable generators are turned on manually whenever they're needed. In the U.S., standard line voltage wiring is wrapped in plastic sheathed cables and usually has three conductors.
