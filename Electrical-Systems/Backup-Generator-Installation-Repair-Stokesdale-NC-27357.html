Over time, due to settling of your building, dust, humidity, chemicals, or other atmospheric conditions, the wires connecting the breakers and circuits of your electrical panel can become loose and corroded. Needless to say this is much more than you will probably need for most of your home outdoor lighting projects.</p>

Electricians usually must complete a minimum number of continuing education hours every year to maintain their license, as well as periodically pass another examination.
