Residential Electrical Contractor: You must hold a license as a Class A or B Master electrician or Residential Master electrician. All electrical items used in and around water (i.e. in the kitchen, bathroom, or wet areas in the basement) should be locked away from children. Portable generators powered by natural gas or propane is the best choice if available. Make sure cords attached to an aquarium have a drip loop—cords that slack below the outlet—to make sure water does not run into the outlet.</p>

<p>A registered electrician should always do new appliances in bathrooms and any new installation of cabling. Outdoor solar lights are a little more expensive to purchase but they are much easier to install. Electrical outlets without any protective covering over the holes of the socket pose a significant risk, particularly to young children.
