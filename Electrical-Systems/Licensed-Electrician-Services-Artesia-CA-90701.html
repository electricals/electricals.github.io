The number, color, and function of the wires at an outlet can be confusing if the original connections are lost track of. Whether the attachment method chosen is screws, push-in holes, or pigtailing with wire connectors, enough insulation must be stripped off the wire for good metal-to-metal contact, and wires should be tugged on to check tightness.</p>

<h3>Scheduling Regular Electrical Maintenance Services in Artesia CA</h3>
<p>While the origins of a residential, commercial and industrial electrician may be the same or similar, the professions are vastly different. Again, the ground wire always gets connected to the green screw, no matter the wiring scenario. In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle. For switches, you will need to first remove the switch and then touch the tester to the sides of all wires to ensure that none are live.</p>
