Brighten up exterior spaces to provide the safety and security you need at night. The thing is, you will never want to wait for an electrical panel problem to get worse.</p>

<p>Take extra care not to throw strings of lights over tree branches that are near power lines and service connections. Depending on just how your outlets were done, you will may have to nut two blacks together on the first outlet, along with a 6" "pigtail" that goes to the outlet. The average American home is hit by more than 20 power surges every single day.
