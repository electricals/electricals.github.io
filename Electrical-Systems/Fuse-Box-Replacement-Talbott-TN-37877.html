As a rule, light fixtures that have lasted for about three decades (25 years plus) in any given building is prone to unstable power supply. A half-hot (or switched) outlet is a duplex outlet that has one half permanently "on" or ready to provide electricity while the other half can be turned off and on via an ordinary wall switch.</p>

If you have electronics plugged into power strips, make sure they have surge protection as well (not all power strips do!). Circuit breakers are designed to trip when overloaded or when there is a short circuit or electrical problem.
