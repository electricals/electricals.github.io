<p>The usual mode for a standby generator is 'idle' however it must be able to immediately start up if the mains power fails. The electricity that comes to our homes from power plants travels at incredibly high voltages because that helps to save energy. Create a point of interest by highlighting a particular tree, shrub, or architectural aspect of you landscape with a flood light placed at ground level and focused upward. Today, almost all electronic devices have components placed on printed circuit boards. It is strongly recommended that you connect all cables and power cords to the unit for providing full maximum protection.</p>
