It depends on the type you are applying for along with the project value you'll be working on. This license is issued by the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance and Board of Licensing Contractors.</p>

Once you are settled in your home and spending some quiet time out on your back deck or patio take some time in the evening to imagine what your back yard or garden area would look night after nightfall if you had some strategically placed lighting incorporated into your landscape and other areas and do not forget to think about adding some additional or different deck lights and lighting surrounding the areas close to the house.</p>

Owners and facility managers who have existing relationships with an electrical contractor, either in terms of maintenance or new installation, have immediate access to a professional who can perform an energy audit for their building.</p>
<p>We can help you get that power with Generac , a trusted name in generators. Installing the right size gas line with proper connectors is very important to the proper function of your generator and a poorly installed gas line will prevent your generator from starting. Afterward, you can rest assured knowing that your home will always have a reliable source of electricity no matter what emergency situation occurs. If the motor starter line circuits are clear, the problem is on the load side of the starter.</p>
