<p>Electricity is ubiquitous in our modern society. Master Electrician - You must show proof of eight years of work experience. An associate degree in electrical technology is perhaps the most popular option for future electricians who choose to attend two-year programs. Once the system detects that you have been disconnected from your utility grid, the generator starts up and transfers its power to the home's electrical panel automatically. When that "other" switch is used to turn lights off, it was "down" and is now switched "up".</p>
<p>Then we install a manual transfer switch in your electrical panel so you can safety and easily switch from the power grid to your generator.
