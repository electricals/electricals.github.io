The armature of the DC motor acts like an electromagnet when current flows through its coils Since the armature (rotor) is located within the magnetic field of the field poles (stator poles), these two fluxes will interact.</p>
<p>If you're pulling wire from a circuit that has 12-gauge wire, don't install 14-gauge wire to the new receptacle or vice versa. When wiring landscape lights, the best place to start is to layout your lighting plan on a piece of paper. It takes approximately 9 months to complete the Residential Electrician program.
