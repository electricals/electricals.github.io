Electrical contractors who do electrical work for the public, as opposed to electricians who work for electrical contractors, often need a special license. Whole house generator installation costs for electrical contractors range from $60-$100 per hour to wire the generator to the electrical panel plus the cost of wire and additional supplies. However, there's one thing wrapped in plastic sheaths or hidden behind walls that can also affect the safety of your home-it's electrical wiring.</p>

All electricians, both residential and industrial, must be licensed by the state in which they work; some states refer to this as certification. NIST reports that "Sending them surges down the drain of a grounding conductor only makes them reappear within a microsecond about 200 meters away on some other conductor." 35 So having protection on a data transmission line is only required if surges are diverted to the ground line.</p>
