<p>Between 1999 and 2002, more than 30 percent of all employee compensation claims from the Independent Electrical Contractors (IEC) were related to ergonomics. In areas with low natural gas pressure, the Guardian Series 22 kW generator can operate on natural gas pressures of only 3.5” of water column. Many low-voltage wiring installation manuals include a table of allowed wattages as a function of wiring distances and wire gauge. Applications for examination must be approved by the State Electrical Board. Here are a few tips concerning the potential hazards associated with your switches and outlets.
