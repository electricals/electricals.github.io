Your transformer should be able to handle the total number of watts connected to it (as determined by adding up the watts needed by the number of fixtures connected to that transformer).</p>

You should never run a portable gas unit indoors because of the carbon monoxide fumes. Always be on the lookout for faulty electrical objects in your home or business - electrical safety should be a top priority. Residential electricians wire houses under construction, and upgrade older houses. So, you need to have a certified, licensed electrician inspect your breaker box.</p>

To install a timer simply remove the plug from the outlet, insert the timer into the outlet, then re-plug the transformer into the outlet on the side of the timer. Remove the old lighting fixture, and make a physical note on paper detailing what wire goes where.
