The Standard for Portable Electric Luminaires, UL 153, covers luminaires with specific requirements for low-voltage lighting systems intended for installation under a shelf, a cabinet or a similar structure.</p>
<p>Home centers carry a limited selection of portable generators (but usually no standby units). Stick with one voltage - 120 volts AC.
