<p>Landscape lighting can go a long way toward making the space more usable even after the sun dips below the horizon. In newer homes, the neutral wires are usually white wires that are capped together and tucked into the back of the wall box without connecting to anything. Use surge protectors, says Danny Lipford, an Alabama-based home improvement expert who dispenses advice on TV, radio and his site, Today's Homeowner These handy devices may look the same as power strips, but in addition to offering multiple outlets, he says, surge protectors divert those brief jumps in voltage to a ground lineâ€”before the harmful jolts can reach your stuff.</p>
<p>It's not worth risking the safety of your crew or the home owners by working with inexperienced, unlicensed electricians or electrical construction teams. If the breaker stays on, try the light switch to assure the fixture lights properly.
