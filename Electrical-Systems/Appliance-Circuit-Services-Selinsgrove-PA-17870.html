<p>In North American practice, an overhead cable from a transformer on a power pole to a residential electrical service usually consists of three twisted (triplexed) conductors, with one being a bare neutral conductor, with the other two being the insulated conductors for both of the two 180-degree out of phase 120 V line voltages normally supplied. When you wire the new outlet only hook up the "hot" wire to the outlet, not the switched wire. Older wire could be aluminum or copper-clad aluminum.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, having the whole house covered against electricity surge doesn't mean you have one of such devices linked to each outlet in the house. Most electrical panels can provide 100 to 800 amps of power and allow for expansion for more circuits to be added.

In some cases, electrical work involves adding another circuit to your breaker panel. A residential electrician will do electrical work in homes, typically installing wiring and power outlets. Electricians who are subject to loud noises, such as those in factories, must wear hearing protection. This failure must be found when the generator is required, such as during a power cut, by implemented a maintenance regime tailored to the specific generator and its applications.</p>
