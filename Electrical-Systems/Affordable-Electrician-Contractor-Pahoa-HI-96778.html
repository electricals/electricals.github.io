Sterlite Power (as a division of STL) was awarded India's first Independent Power Transmission Project under Tariff Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) regime. As such, landscape lighting fixtures are best hidden within bushes or rock formations and properly oriented to highlight the leaves in a tall tree or wash up a textural wall.

<p>That path, which relies on numerous parts that can often be loose, is unreliable: the path is from the new grounded receptacle's internal grounding connector through a rivet to a metal strap on the body of the receptacle, through mounting screws through the receptacle's mounting ears, through a threaded hole in the metal receptacle box, through a metal BX connector which itself relies on at least four parts to be secured to the metal box, through a set screw from that connector into the armored cable, and through god knows how many more sets of these parts down the entire remainder of the electrical circuit.</p>
<p>Solid copper wires do not need to be twisted together, but I recommend twisting wire to ensure strong permanent connection.

The auxiliary contacts are then available for use in the control circuit of the original machine or another machine.</p>
