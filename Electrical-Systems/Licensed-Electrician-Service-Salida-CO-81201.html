<p>Properly matched transformers and fixtures light your yard for nighttime safety. That means more circuit breakers must be installed. Its important to have a basic understanding of how an electrical panel works. One of the most common mistakes of troubleshooters is to change or correct several supposed troubles at one time before trying the circuit for operation.

Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device. Portable generators usually offer between 2 and 8 kilowatts; 4 to 6 kW is usually enough to power a home's essential appliances, like lights and a portable heater, says Yago. Check with your salesperson when buying the transformer if it will do the job for the number of lights you plan to use.</p>
