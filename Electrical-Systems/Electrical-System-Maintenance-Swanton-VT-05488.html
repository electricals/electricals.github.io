<p>This wiring as pre-existing or "old-work" electrical wiring, is still described in the U.S. National Electrical Code (2005) in Article 394. Many homes built before the 1960's are powered by electrical panels that are equipped with fuses. Fuse boxes are not as much of a concern as the fuses that you have to put in them. Also, do not touch electrical appliances with wet hands. Spot lights can be angled and used with shrouds to direct the light exactly where desired.</p>
<p>Report any broken poles or trees on the power line or any downed electric lines to NOVEC or the police immediately. The journeyman electrician exam will determine whether or not electrician training has been fruitful. If your house still contains a fuse panel, you should upgrade to a standard breaker panel. Restricted Electrical Licences (RELs) are issued to persons other than electricians to legally carry out a "restricted" range of electrical tasks.

A less expensive way to go - and your only option if you've purchased the generator online - is to hire a plumber to connect the unit to its fuel source (usually propane or natural gas, though some run on diesel) and an electrician to hook it into your house's power supply.</p>
<p>Licenses Issued Through: No state licensing; some municipalities (e.g., City of Chicago's Department of Buildings , City of Aurora ) license journeymen and electrical contractors; separate licensing is required for firms that install or maintain fire and burglar alarm systems. While the entire duplex outlet could be turned on via a wall switch, only one of the two plug-ins is usually switched; this leaves the other half permanently powered for other uses.</p>
