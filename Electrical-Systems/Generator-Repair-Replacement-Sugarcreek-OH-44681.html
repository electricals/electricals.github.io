<p>Whether you own the home in which you live or you are simply renting for the moment, it is important to have a safe understanding of how your electrical circuit wiring works.

<p>Improper Installation - If your home's breaker panel wasn't installed correctly the first time around, you may be experiencing frequent issues with it. Some surge protectors allow you time enough to shut down your computer without losing data or causing damage. Flickering lights, odd sounds from a fuse box, tripping breakers, and even smoke coming from outlets or outlets with burning smells are all warning signs of an outdated panel.
