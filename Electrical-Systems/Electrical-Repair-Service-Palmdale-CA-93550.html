<p>In-field installation costs can be higher, since SM devices are installed in series with the power feed, requiring the feed to be cut and reconnected. To save on electricity costs, attach a photocell to your transformer so the lights automatically come on at sunset and go off at sunrise.

Not only does this save you power by reducing any phantom drain (the amount of energy the device consumes even when not actively in use), but unplugging unused appliances also protects them from overheating or power surges. The auxiliary contacts are then available for use in the control circuit of the original machine or another machine.</p>
<p>Commercial grade outlets and switches are better in every way but it's most evident in outlets. Wiring for these types of garden lights must be buried at a depth of 18 inches or encased in conduit to protect it from water.

Without a breaker panel, none of your electronic devices or appliances will work.

Most of the time, this would simply require making sure that the light switch that operates the ceiling fixture, is turned to the off position.</p>
<p>This requires you to have spare fuses on hand at a moment's notice, and while it may sound simple, it can be quite intimidating to someone who is new to it.

Candidates must show proof of working as an electrician and having completed an apprenticeship program.
