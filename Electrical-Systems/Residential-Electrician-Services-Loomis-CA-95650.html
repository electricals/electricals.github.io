Some of the changes to restrictions that were set out in the new Part P aspect of the building regulations were seen as being controversial as under the new regulations, the undertaking of any work other than simple changes such as changing a light switch became notifiable to the local building control authority; so work such as any work in a kitchen or bathroom or work in other areas that are being re-wired will require a professional body, i.e. a trained electrician, to carry them out.</p>
<p>Newer systems include power-quality measurement to enable better understanding and control of loads in each segment of the distribution system. Our licensed specialists not only have experience in panel work, but in all general electrical services you need us to complete in your home, so you can rely upon us to perform these, and other electrical services when you hire us for the job.

<p>Avoid putting extension cords under rugs or carpet and only use outdoor-rated extension cords outside. For example, if you connect the incoming "hot" wire and neutral wire to the "load" terminals on a GFCI, and if you connect wires leading to downstream electrical receptacles to the "line" terminals (these are the incorrect connections), then pushing the test button on the GFCI will not activate that device's internal trip mechanism.

Based on the 2014 requirements and the restrictions in Chapter 9 Tables 11(A) and 11(B), a small and simple low voltage lighting installation, such as those commonly installed under the kitchen cabinets, might require several Class 2 power supplies in order to comply with the code language and stay within the maximum power requirements for a Class 2 power supply.</p>
