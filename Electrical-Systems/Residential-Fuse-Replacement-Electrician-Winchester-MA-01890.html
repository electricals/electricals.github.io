<p>With custom outdoor landscape lighting. Outdoor living spaces are becoming havens for homeowners and this is partially due to advanced in exterior lighting. This course introduces participants to AC motor controllers, which are devices, or groups of devices, that control the operation of alternating current (AC) motors.

<p>Automatic standby generators are complex machines designed to work in emergency situations. In the event of a blackout, there is a specific kind of surge protector that can prevent loss of important information by acting as a storage cell for power, giving you enough time to save your work and power down your machine. Most sensitive electronic equipment (i.e. televisions, stereos, computers, faxes, printers, etc.) may not tolerate that voltage and will require a second line of defense provided by a point-of-use surge arrestor”.</p>
<p>The application of LED's as landscape lighting fixtures was realized in the later half of the 20th century as more and more people focused in furthering lawn improvements and finding new ways to enhancing landscape designs with lights that would not pose much risk and at the same time would cut the operational cost over time.
