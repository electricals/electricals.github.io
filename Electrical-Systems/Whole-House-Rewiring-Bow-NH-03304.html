<p>Task lighting is used to focus on areas you will be working in. Enclosed fixtures are typically found in halls, bedrooms & bathrooms. The licenses are awarded by the Board of State Examiners of Electricians. Extension cords are generally rated in amps and volts. Depending on your situation, the power outage can last for several days and not having electricity for so long can be dangerous - especially if you run into an emergency.

<p>Breakers that trip regularly, however, signal a larger issue like an overloaded circuit. Single-phase motors normally are limited to fractional horsepower ratings up to 5 horsepower.
