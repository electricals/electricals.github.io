There may be other wires in the box, but you are only dealing with the ones connected directly to the switch. If the power originates in the outlet then that white wire is most likely not a neutral at all, but either a constant hot or a switched hot.</p>

<p>I have a 1974 home in Maine, a ranch with 200 amp breaker box service. LED fixtures can vary in voltage and will all be the same brightness as long as between 10 and 15 volts is being supplied to each fixture.
