When it comes to electricity, there are two main dangers: shocks and fires. This is a fabric- and rubber-insulated multi-strand electrical wire.</p>
<p>For instance, instead of 14 AWG ( American wire gauge ) copper wire, aluminium wiring would need to be 12 AWG on a typical 15 ampere lighting circuit, though local building codes vary. It's also worth considering the placement of light switches if family members are getting older or have lost mobility and would have trouble reaching a switch while seated in a wheelchair. A digital timer may be used for more complex lighting systems where multiple start times are required including start times on different days of the week.</p>

<p>I pig-tailed my hots, neutrals, & grounds (well crimped & trimmed all but 1), which obviously gives you longer wire to work with the receptacle, but it also made tucking the rest of the wire into the receptacle easier.
