Do insert cord plugs fully into the power outlet. When you consider that every year around 6700 fires are reported as having an electrical source, you can see just how important electrical safety really is. This statistic includes fires started by faulty or inadequate wiring. A two-year post-high school electrical course with a degree in electrical technology can substitute for one year of experience.

<p>The 100 amp electrical service in your home is insufficient for operating necessary appliances. Part of the current from the black wire will return through the white wire on the red wire GFCI, causing an imbalance in both GFCI's. This connects to the generator so you can plug in appliances without running (potentially risky) extension cords outdoors. The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it. If they did, then you could add up 200 amps of solar since you would be coming in ahead of the main breaker.</p>
