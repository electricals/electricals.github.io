<p>Enjoy the beauty of your landscape (and sure footing) after sunset with low voltage lighting. The transformer is what makes the system low voltage, as it takes the usual 120-volt house current and brings it down to 12 volts.

General Journey Level Electrician: 8,000 hours of work experience in electrical training under certified supervision.</p>
<p>When considering an upgrade to your home's electrical wiring, you must take into account the age of your home and the age of the current wiring that is installed. Lights in your home do little good if you can't turn them on, and the power going through your home is useless if your outlets aren't ready and capable to handle appliances. Flickering fluorescent lights, broken light switches, and old wiring are no match for lighting repair professionals. We do want to make it clear, though, that are probably a lot of great small electrical engineering firms out there; we just focused on the larger firms based on specific requests and available information.</p>
