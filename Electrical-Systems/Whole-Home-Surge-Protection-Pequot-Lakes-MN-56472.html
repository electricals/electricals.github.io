<p>Not only that, landscape lighting makes your property look more luxurious and expensive, leading to increased value. With the average lifespan of a home now greater than 35 years and technology's rapid rate of progression, the answer is likely no. Today's gadgets and appliances easily overload electrical systems in many of today's older homes, causing issues that could easily be prevented with a new electrical panel. If your home or business facility's electrical panel is beyond repair, it's time to consider a full replacement or upgrade.</p>
<p>Electrical panels are sometimes called breaker boxes, electrical boards, or service boxes.
