Today's gadgets and appliances easily overload electrical systems in many of today's older homes, causing issues that could easily be prevented with a new electrical panel. If your home or business facility's electrical panel is beyond repair, it's time to consider a full replacement or upgrade.</p>
<p>Electrical panels are sometimes called breaker boxes, electrical boards, or service boxes.
