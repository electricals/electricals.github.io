<p>Electrical demands created by modern technology put more stress on older electrical systems. Learn how to identify the electrical safety hazards you can't see before problems arise. Selection of fixtures which blend with garden or landscape needs to seriously planned and decided. Older standby generators were very noisy. After the holidays are over, we will carefully remove your lighting display which will then be packaged, and transported back to our secure warehouse.
