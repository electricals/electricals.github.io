Use surge protectors, says Danny Lipford, an Alabama-based home improvement expert who dispenses advice on TV, radio and his site, Today's Homeowner These handy devices may look the same as power strips, but in addition to offering multiple outlets, he says, surge protectors divert those brief jumps in voltage to a ground line—before the harmful jolts can reach your stuff.</p>
<p>Standby generators also run a weekly test to check that they will respond well to an outage. Most of the time, they occur insidiously, when faulty electrical wiring heats up and begins to smolder gradually. Step 1.

This system is made up of low-voltage switches that operate relays that actually turn line-voltage on or off to the switched device. The circuit breaker panel in your home or business is the heart of your electrical system.

<p>For example, devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners require large amounts of energy to switch motors and compressors on and off, creating surges in power that disrupt the steady flow of voltage.
