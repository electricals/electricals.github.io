<p>While the origins of a residential, commercial and industrial electrician may be the same or similar, the professions are vastly different. Again, the ground wire always gets connected to the green screw, no matter the wiring scenario. In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle. For switches, you will need to first remove the switch and then touch the tester to the sides of all wires to ensure that none are live.</p>
<p>And since they're low voltage (you can literally add wires and lights to the system while it's operating), they're safe to use and install. This system is made up of low-voltage switches that operate relays that actually turn line-voltage on or off to the switched device. The circuit breaker panel in your home or business is the heart of your electrical system.

Once the charging system is installed, consumers should take safety precautions such as never using an extension cord to charge the vehicle and regularly inspecting cords and plugs for damage.</p>
<p>As you can see, a lamp with a design voltage of 12 Volts will deliver 80% of its light output and its life will double by reducing the voltage to 11.5 Volts.
