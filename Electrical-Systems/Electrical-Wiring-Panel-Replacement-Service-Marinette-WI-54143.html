<p>Decks are more likely to be used at night than in the daytime. Since low voltage lighting gives lesser illumination, each lighting fixture should be 8 to 10 feet away from each other. Green or bare copper are ground wires. To sum up, whether you need light fixtures installed or replaced, or lighting problems fixed, such as a loose wire in the socket, a tripped breaker and a blown fuse, as well as have circuit path issues addressed, we've got you covered. Water conducts electricity, and you could get an electric shock. Use extreme caution whenever you're working on the electrical system, and if you are not confident about doing the job safely, contact a qualified, licensed electrician.</p>

<p>If our technician determines that your lighting fixture is broken, he can install a new one. To do electrical work, you must get an electrical contractor license from us. You must have a valid UBI number, either a $4,000 bond or assignment of savings, and a designated master electrician or administrator. Transfer switches cost $500-$900.

Purchasing a generator from Electric Generators Direct provides you with the same service options as if you were to purchase one from your local home improvement warehouse.</p>

<p>There are only a few people who still perform electric installation, as it can be a dangerous task, especially if one is inexperienced.
