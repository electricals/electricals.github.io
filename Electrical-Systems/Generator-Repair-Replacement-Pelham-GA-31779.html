Although it's an electrical application, low voltage lighting takes very little energy to run and is relatively safe. Keep electrical cords out of the way. If your property doesn't have an exterior ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet, essential for powering a low voltage lighting system, a licensed electrician will have to add one, which will add to the expense. Lay the lights out where you want to install them. Our residential electrical services ensure all home wiring is not only performed correctly and code … but that it will live up to current and future electrical requirements and continue to safely perform for years to come.</p>

The replacement may simply involve installing a new receptacle, but it could also require replacing wires or the box as well.</p>
<p>The National Electrical Code (NEC) and local building codes regulate the types of wire and cable that can be used in specific electrical applications, as well as the manner of installation. Instead, splice the neutrals from the feed to the GFCI and the under-sink outlet together, splice a short jumper to the black feed to the GFCI, and connect that jumper to a new switch.
