<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Service in Moncks Corner</h2>
<p>Landscape lighting can improve the apparent and visible features of a variety of landscapes as well as architectures magnificently. In fact, according to the National Fire Protection Association, fires starting in electrical systems or lighting equipment damage 24,000 homes and kill 320 people each year. Our Service Department provides that same level of customer service and electrical know-how to residential, industrial and commercial customers with project ranging from installing a single ceiling fan to complete service upgrades and electrical repairs.

Bi-fuel and dual fuel generators fit these criteria. Electrical outlets and lighting switches will always stay the same size - only the overall dimensions of your switchplates will change.</p>
