If the wires are screwed into the terminal screws on the side, simply unscrew them. When there is more than one fault, the troubleshooting is exponentially more difficult, do not assume that all problems are solved after completing one, always test the circuit and operation prior to returning the equipment to service. Now that you know what types of generators are available, talk with a professional to help you decide whether a standby or portable one is right for you.</p>
<p>Repair, upgrade or install your lighting with the utmost care and attention to detail. It should not be used without having a properly installed generator transfer switch.
