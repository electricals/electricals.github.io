<p>One of the key to proper electrical wiring installation is the use of correct letters and colors of electrical wires. However, smaller portables such as 1000 watts units can be used for such things as microwaves, toasters and other electrical cooking devices. Most homes on the city grid often use natural gas to power space heating and other appliances, including backup generators.
