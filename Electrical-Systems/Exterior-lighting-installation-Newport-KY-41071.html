Then you will use a similar item known as a Quick Connector to fasten the laid-out cable to each light fixture. And also, for your safety, throw off the master switch for the fuse box, just to be sure you don't get shocked when putting in the new one.</p>
<p>The average homeowner should not attempt to install electrical outlets, particularly if you are making the switch to a 3-pronged outlet.

Around 10 watts of power running through halogen bulbs gives you complete control over your deck lighting needs.
