<p>Make sure you attach the correct wires to the correct screws. Almost every building has an electrical power, communications, lighting, and control system that is installed during construction and maintained after that. A short circuit is generally an abnormal low-resistance current, in between two nodes of an electrical circuit that are usually meant to have different voltages. In that instance, it may be time for an upgrade to the electrical panel. None of those standards guarantee that a protector will provide proper protection in a given application.</p>
