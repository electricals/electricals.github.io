Inside your house, you have a complex web of electrical wires just like you do veins in your own body.</p>
<p>Return of investment of these systems really depends on how much you spend a month on your power and depending on how much you paid for your solar power generator it can takes a couple of years to make your money back. Experts say that in addition to the generator itself, consumers should also buy a transfer switch, which connects the generator to the circuit box of your home, and fuel for the generator.
