Upgrading your electric panel ensures that all of your new appliances are supported and that your family and home are safe from any dangers that might occur from overloading your system.

<p>I have a 1974 home in Maine, a ranch with 200 amp breaker box service.

Label the switches in the breaker box. Will require a Ground Fault circuit breaker or plug, UNLESS it is dedicated to a "fixed" appliance such as a washer, refrigerator, etc. Legrand, a French electrical company and world leader in electrical and digital building infrastructures, was formed in 1904 when Frederic Legrand, Charles Alary and Jean Joquel bought a porcelain dish making workshop and named it Legrand, Alary and Joquel Company.</p>
