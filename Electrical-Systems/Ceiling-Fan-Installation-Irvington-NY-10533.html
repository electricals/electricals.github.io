<p>When the safety device is actuated (when the door comes in contact with an object during downward travel), the circuit will cause the motor to step and reverse the door to the fully open position. With the generator running, the switch closed, and the voltmeter probes attached to the current conductor and neutral conductor connections of the motor, the voltmeter will indicate the voltage potential at the motor. Remove the old light from its socket and remove the twist-on wire connectors securing the electrical conductors to the fixture.</p>
