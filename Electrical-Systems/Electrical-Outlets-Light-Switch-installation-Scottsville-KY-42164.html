However, testing from the current and potential transformers (CTs and PTs) offers an easy alternative method to gather the required voltage and current signals to assist in troubleshooting. Installing low-voltage outdoor lighting is a big-impact DIY project. Use electrical appliances and tools only in dry locations and situations. As mentioned above, circuit breakers are a more modern version of fuses.</p>
<p>For safe wire connections, cut all the wires to leave at least 6 in. protruding past the face of the box.

To figure out how big your generator's output needs to be, make a list of all the appliances you'll need during an outage and add up their surge wattsâthe amount of electricity a motor needs to start (see image 3). Add to this total the run watts for electrical items without motors, such as lightbulbs, water heaters, and television sets.</p>
