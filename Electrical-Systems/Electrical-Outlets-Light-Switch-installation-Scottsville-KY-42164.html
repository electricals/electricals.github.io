Our 24 hour electrician does not relieve customers with just a temporary fix, but resolves the problem at hand for good. However, testing from the current and potential transformers (CTs and PTs) offers an easy alternative method to gather the required voltage and current signals to assist in troubleshooting. Installing low-voltage outdoor lighting is a big-impact DIY project. Use electrical appliances and tools only in dry locations and situations. As mentioned above, circuit breakers are a more modern version of fuses.</p>
<p>For safe wire connections, cut all the wires to leave at least 6 in. protruding past the face of the box.

To figure out how big your generator's output needs to be, make a list of all the appliances you'll need during an outage and add up their surge watts—the amount of electricity a motor needs to start (see image 3). Add to this total the run watts for electrical items without motors, such as lightbulbs, water heaters, and television sets.</p>
