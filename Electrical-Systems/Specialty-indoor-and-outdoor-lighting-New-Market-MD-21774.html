From this spot - often referred to as the service drop or service wire - your service panel directs electricity to different parts of the home. Typical applications include monitoring ground cables, or a.c. voltage network cabling, to detect the effects of remote lightning strikes or surges due to machinery or switchgear. Our 24 Hour electrical repair team will arrive properly equipped, tooled and with after hour access to our local parts warehouse to minimize any additional delays or down time.</p>
<p>Automatic standby generators are complex machines designed to work in emergency situations. In the event of a blackout, there is a specific kind of surge protector that can prevent loss of important information by acting as a storage cell for power, giving you enough time to save your work and power down your machine. Most sensitive electronic equipment (i.e. televisions, stereos, computers, faxes, printers, etc.) may not tolerate that voltage and will require a second line of defense provided by a point-of-use surge arrestor‚Äù.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, that like most of the older Generac generators this one probably shouldn't be used if you're anticipating days and days of your power being out.
