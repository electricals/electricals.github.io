Other low-voltage wiring system transformers feature timers to turn the lights off and on at designated times. As a customer-focused company, we take the time to discuss your specific lighting needs, the timeline, and your budget. Power surges can often come as a result of storms during hurricane season, but they can occur every day from other grid disruptions.
