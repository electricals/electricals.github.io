<p>You don't want to hire someone who has outlandish prices, but at the same time, you don't want to sacrifice quality for price, especially when it comes to electrical wiring. Or, complete 12,000 hours in electrical installations along with passing an exam.

However, this requires electrical contractors to take some steps in areas they are less used to: on top of skillsets with regards to electricity, they need skillsets with regards to essential IT and IoT know-how.
