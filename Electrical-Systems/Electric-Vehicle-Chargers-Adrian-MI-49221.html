As a rule, light fixtures that have lasted for about three decades (25 years plus) in any given building is prone to unstable power supply. A half-hot (or switched) outlet is a duplex outlet that has one half permanently "on" or ready to provide electricity while the other half can be turned off and on via an ordinary wall switch.</p>

For normal indoor electrical wiring like lighting and receptacle circuits, use NM electrical cables. Different appliances draw different amounts of current, so an electric toaster will need a higher fuse (typically 13 amp) than an electric light (usually just 3 amp).
