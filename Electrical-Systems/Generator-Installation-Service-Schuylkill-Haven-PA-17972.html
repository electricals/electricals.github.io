<p>One of the key to proper electrical wiring installation is the use of correct letters and colors of electrical wires. No other landscaping company in the Hollywood, Santa Monica, and Malibu area will offer you a 5-year warranty on a lighting installation. You should have the white from the panel and a jumper from the black to the panel connected to the outlet, on opposite sides.
