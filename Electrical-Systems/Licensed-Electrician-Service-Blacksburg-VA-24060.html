Landscape lighting is easy to install and has a higher profit margin than almost any other landscape project.

Get an electrical engineer to estimate how much amperage you need to add before planning to install central heat and air or new appliances such as an electric range, a dryer, and others, which use 240-volt power. This is useful to check that there is no current flow through the wire (the circuit is dead) before you start to dismantle the old switch.</p>
