<p>Electricity is one of the most important aspects to a home. From outdoor portable generators that provide power for your home, work and play moments, to high-definition TVs that are setting new standards for performance, we're constantly developing advanced products, rigorously testing them to make sure they work time after time, day after day. This GLOMACS Electrical Engineering training seminar on Troubleshooting & Maintenance of Electrical Equipment has been developed to assist Electrical personnel to be able to understand, maintain and troubleshoot common problems and some uncommon problems, within modern and existing Electrical Equipment.</p>

This will help you avoid voltage drop, which occurs when not enough current reaches the lights at the end of a run, McGowan says. LED and other low voltage lights come in a huge variety of styles and are perfect for creating soft and elegant mood lighting.</p>
<p>You'll probably know if you've had a lightning strike, but you might not know that every time an electrical appliance cycles on or off, there may be small voltage spikes degrading that surge protector every day. It could be that your living room never had can lights installed and you are tired of relying on lamps.

With rapidly advancing landscape lighting technologies, a lot of homes (even less than a decade old) have landscape lighting systems that are out of date.</p>
