<p>Make sure all outdoor outlets are equipped with ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) to help prevent electric shock. If an electric gadget gets wet, do not touch it or unplug it. First, switch the electricity off at the circuit breaker panel, then unplug it. Wait for it to dry out completely before using it again.

Watch the video below to learn more about the Generac standby generators that Blanton's installs.
