Each panel has varying wire size and the size depends on the electrical panel installation and the size of the meter.</p>
<p>If the lights are wired separately from the receptacles, they will remain on while the problem is fixed.

The more power you use, and the longer runtime the generator needs to provide it, the more fuel you need.</p>

Our 24-hour emergency electricians are never more than a phone call away.
